For example, consider (10 - 5) = 5, then attempt to multiply or add this with remaining numbers cautiously.

Avoid attempting to directly multiply two numbers to reach 24 if it results in mismanaging the remaining set; for example, using 4\u00d76=24 is valid mathematically but problematic if you do not account for the updated remaining numbers properly.\n\nKey refined strategies include:\n\n1. **Use addition and subtraction to create intermediate targets**: For example, (10 - 5) = 5, which can serve as a stepping stone toward 24.\n\n2. **Focus on forming intermediate multiples like 12**: Since 12 is half of 24, look for ways to create 12 via combinations such as (6\u00d72) or (10 - (4+5)). Once 12 is established, doubling it (if allowed) or adding appropriate numbers can reach 24.\n\n3. **Combine small operations carefully**: For example, pairing (10 - 5) = 5 with 4 and 6 to reach 24, by first creating 12 (via 6\u00d72 or 10 - (4+5)), then doubling or adding as needed,",

Moves resulting in remaining numbers like 5, 10, or 24 are often unpromising if they stem from invalid operations or lead to dead ends. Specifically, avoid steps that involve combining numbers in ways that violate the rules\u2014such as reusing numbers or performing operations that are not permissible within the move sequence. For example, attempting to multiply 4 and 6 to get 24 is invalid if it breaches the rule of single-use per number or if the operation's context (e.g., using numbers not available or reusing a number) is not allowed. After each move, assess the remaining numbers: if the result is 24 or leaves only numbers"

The previous attempt erroneously used 2, which does not exist in the set, highlighting the importance of strictly adhering to the original numbers at each step.\n\nKey refined strategies:\n\n1. **Prioritize creating 12 from available numbers**: Since 12 is half of 24, generating 12 simplifies the path to 24. Possible ways include:\n   - Using multiplication: if you have a pair like 6 and 2, but since 2 isn't in the set, look for other combinations.\n   - Using addition/subtraction: for example, (10 - 4) = 6, and then combining with other numbers to reach 12.\n\n2. **Use addition and subtraction to generate intermediate targets**: For example:\n   - (10 - 5) = 5, which can help in forming 12 or 24.\n   - (6 + 4) = 10, which can combine with other operations.\n\n3. **Combine small intermediate results carefully**: For instance, after generating 12 (e.g., from (10 + 5) - 3 if 3 existed, but it doesn't), look to double it or add other numbers to reach 24. Since doubling 12 gives 24, focus on creating 12 first.\n\n4. **Avoid illegal operations**: Do not multiply or manipulate numbers to produce values not present initially",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the Game of 24 for the numbers 4, 5, 6, and 10, a clear set of principles emerges to distinguish promising from unpromising steps. The core criterion is adherence to the rules: each number must be used exactly once, and only valid operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are permitted. Moves that introduce numbers outside the original set\u2014either by creating new values through invalid operations or reusing numbers\u2014are fundamentally unpromising and should be avoided. For example, attempting to generate a number like 2 from 6 by multiplying or dividing is invalid unless that 2 was already part of the initial set or legitimately derived through permitted operations. Consequently, moves that result in remaining numbers such as 5, 10, or 24 without progressing towards a target or that rely on invalid computations are typically dead ends. Promising steps are those that combine existing numbers using legitimate operations to produce intermediate results closer to 24, ensuring no rule violations occur. After each move, the evaluation should focus on whether the remaining set offers a viable pathway to 24, either directly"

Drawing from the 'Previous Value Summary' and the insights gained from recent attempts, we can synthesize a concise, robust evaluation framework that guides decision-making and move assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Core Principles for Move Evaluation\n\n1. **Adherence to Game Rules:**\n   - **Use each number exactly once per move:** Every operation should incorporate two distinct numbers from the current set, and after the operation, these two numbers are replaced with their result.\n   - **Valid operations only:** Addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7). No other operations or manipulations are permitted.\n   - **No introducing external numbers:** All intermediate and final results must be derived solely from the initial set through legitimate operations.\n\n2. **Proper Management of the Number Set:**\n   - **No dropping or reusing numbers improperly:** After combining two numbers, the set must be updated by removing those two used numbers and adding the result. No numbers should be omitted without being combined, nor should any be reused across multiple operations within the same move.\n   - **Tracking the set state:** The resulting set after each move should accurately reflect the numbers remaining, without duplication or omission, unless justified by the operation.\n\n3. **Progress Towards the Goal (24):**\n   - **Beneficial moves are those that produce intermediate results closer to 24:** For example, results like 12, 8, 16, or other factors of 24 are promising as stepping stones.\n   - **Avoid moves that lead to dead ends or regress:** For instance, producing results that are far from 24 or repeating previous states without progress.\n\n4. **Legal Set Transitions:**\n   - **Set consistency:** The new set after each move must be a valid, legal transformation from the previous set\u2014no dropping of numbers without combining, no reusing numbers improperly, and no introducing extraneous values.\n   - **Avoid illegal recombinations:** Combining numbers in a way that violates the set's integrity\u2014such as reusing a number multiple times or dropping numbers without proper combination\u2014is unpromising.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Insights from Recent Attempts (Applying the Principles):\n\n**Case Study: Numbers 4, 5, 6, 10**\n\n- **Initial Set:** 4, 5, 6, 10  \n  *Evaluation:* This is the starting point; thus, it is considered"

Recent attempts highlight key lessons that refine our understanding of promising steps, especially emphasizing the importance of legality and meaningful progress.\n\n**1. Strict Compliance with Game Rules:**\n- **Use each number exactly once per move:** Every operation must combine two *distinct* numbers from the current set, replacing them with their result.\n- **Operations are limited to +, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7:** No other operations or manipulations are permitted.\n- **No external or extraneous numbers:** All intermediate results must derive solely from the initial set through valid operations.\n\n**2. Accurate Management of the Number Set:**\n- **Maintain set integrity:** After each move, the set must be updated by removing the two used numbers and adding the resulting value. Any deviation\u2014such as reusing a number or dropping one without proper operation\u2014is unpromising.\n- **Avoid illegal recombinations:** For example, attempting to divide by a number not present in the current set (e.g., dividing by 2 when 2 isn't in the set) violates legality and indicates a move should be discarded.\n\n**3. Moves that Progress Toward 24:**\n- **Prioritize intermediate results that are factors or multiples of 24:** Achieving intermediate numbers like 12, 8, 6, 4, or 3 signals promising pathways.\n- **Avoid regress or dead ends:** Moves that produce results significantly distant from 24 or that revert to previous states without progress are unpromising.\n\n**4.
