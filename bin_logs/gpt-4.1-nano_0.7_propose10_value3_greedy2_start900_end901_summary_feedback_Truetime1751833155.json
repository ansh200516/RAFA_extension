From past attempts, a key insight is to utilize division early to generate manageable numbers, but always verify the legality of each operation\u2014each number can only be used once per step, and intermediate results must be derived directly from the original set or previous valid results.\n\nA promising approach is to examine the division of larger numbers by smaller ones to produce neat fractions that can be combined to reach 24. For example, dividing 10 by 5 yields 2, which is a manageable number for further operations. After this step, remaining numbers are 2, 6, and 10, but subsequent operations must be carefully chosen\u2014adding, subtracting, or multiplying\u2014to approach 24.\n\nFrom the previous analysis, combining 6 and 10 through addition yields 16, which is close but requires further adjustment. Multiplying 5 by 4 (if feasible) to reach 20 is another route, but since 4 is not directly involved after the initial division, it may be better to focus on the current set. For example, from 2 and 6, multiplying to get 12, then adding 10 yields 22, still close but not exact. Alternatively, dividing 6 by 2 gives 3, which can be combined with other numbers to reach 24.\n\nOverall, the key is to generate intermediate targets like 12, 16, or 20 and combine them with remaining numbers to reach 24.

Promising moves are those that systematically combine numbers to inch closer to 24 while maintaining legal, feasible steps.

Avoid assuming any number not present initially; all steps must derive directly from the given numbers. First, consider dividing larger numbers to produce manageable factors\u2014for example, dividing 10 by 5 yields 2, simplifying subsequent calculations. Use this to create key intermediate numbers; for instance, 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 directly solves the puzzle. Alternatively, combining 10 and 5 to get 50, then dividing by 5, yields 10, which can be reused or combined with other numbers.

Effective moves are those that produce valid intermediate results while actively reducing the problem's complexity. Moves that combine two numbers using permissible operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014must adhere strictly to game rules: each operation uses exactly two current numbers, and the resulting value replaces those two, decreasing the total count of numbers by one.\n\nFrom the previous summaries, we observe that moves prioritizing straightforward, high-impact operations are more promising. For example, multiplying 4 and 6 to reach 24 directly is an optimal move because it achieves the target in a single step. Similarly, dividing 10 by 5 to produce 2 simplifies the problem and opens pathways to combine remaining numbers into 24. Conversely, moves involving unnecessary or invalid reuse of numbers\u2014such as attempting to generate a new number outside the current list without proper operation\u2014are unpromising and often invalid.\n\nThe recent learning highlights the importance of step legality: each step must be performed by selecting two numbers from the current list, performing a legal operation, and replacing these two with the result. Any attempt to use a number or value not present in the current list violates rules and renders the move invalid. For instance, creating a '20' from 4 and 5 (via multiplication) is valid, but subsequent steps that rely on reusing old numbers improperly or reusing results without re-deriving them can lead to illegal moves. Additionally, moves that do not progress toward 24\u2014such as operations that produce"

Recognize that 4 \u00d7 6 = 24 provides an immediate solution, so prioritize multiplicative pairing of 4 and 6. Avoid invalid operations such as reusing numbers beyond their initial count or creating values like 20 from non-existent sums. Use division strategically: dividing 10 by 5 yields 2, which can help reach 24 via 4 \u00d7 6 or combine with other results. Since only one of each number is available, do not attempt to double or reuse numbers. For example, avoid steps like 20 / 5 = 4, which involve non-available intermediate sums",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the Game of 24 for the numbers 4, 5, 6, and 10, it is essential to develop a clear, rule-based framework that guides the identification of promising versus unpromising steps. The core principles hinge on legality, strategic progress, and the impact of each move on simplifying the problem toward reaching 24.\n\n**Legal move criteria** are paramount. Each operation must utilize only the current set of available numbers, with each number used exactly once per move. Intermediate results\u2014like 20 or 24\u2014are considered new numbers only if the rules explicitly permit creating and carrying forward such results. Importantly, reusing the same number within a move (e.g., adding 5 + 5) is invalid unless multiple instances are present initially. Dropping numbers intentionally or creating results that do not adhere to the original constraints breaches the rules.\n\n**Strategic evaluation** involves recognizing moves that directly solve or substantially simplify the problem. For example, multiplying 4 and 6 to get 24 is an immediate solution, making it highly promising. Conversely, dividing 10 by 5 to produce 2 reduces complexity and opens alternative pathways, which can be promising if it leads closer to 24 in subsequent steps.\n\n**Progression and simplification** are critical. Moves that reduce the number of remaining options or produce intermediary results closer to 24 are more promising. For instance, dividing 20 (from 4 and 5) by 5 to get 4, or combining small results to approach 24, are strategies aligned with effective problem-solving.\n\n**Invalid moves** are those that violate the rules\u2014such as attempting to use a number not in the current set, reusing a number improperly, or creating intermediate results that cannot"

Recognize that dividing 10 by 5 yields 2, which can be combined with 4 and 6 to reach 24 (e.g., 2 \u00d7 12, with 12 from 6 \u00d7 2). Prioritize operations that produce intermediate results close to 24 or 12, enabling straightforward multiplications. Do not attempt to",

Moves that reduce the number of remaining options or produce intermediary results closer to 24 are also valuable, particularly if they enable subsequent successful operations.

Leverage straightforward multiplication of pairs that produce intermediate numbers close to or useful for 24. For example, combining 4 and 5 yields 20, which is a strong candidate because it is close to 24 and can be manipulated further.\n\n2. Use the results of initial multiplications to generate larger numbers that can facilitate reaching 24 indirectly. For instance, multiplying 20 by 6 yields 120, which, although larger than 24, can sometimes be useful for division or subtraction in more complex puzzles. However, in this specific case, such steps lead away from 24, indicating the importance of selective operations.\n\n3. Recognize when certain combinations cannot lead to 24. For these, avoid exhaustive attempts that involve complex operations unlikely to produce 24 given the initial set. For example, attempts to derive 24 directly from 4, 5, 6, 10 through addition or subtraction often fail unless specific combinations (like 6 / (10 - 5) * 4) are considered, but these may involve fractional or invalid intermediate steps.\n\n4.

Reusing or re-creating numbers without valid operations leads to invalid steps.\n\n2. **Prioritize operations that produce intermediate numbers close to 24.** For example, multiplying 4 and 5 yields 20, which is near 24 and easier to adjust via addition or subtraction. Such \"near targets\" can guide subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Avoid invalid shortcuts or assumptions.** For instance, creating 20 directly from 4 and 10 is invalid unless explicitly derived (e.g., 4 \u00d7 5 = 20). Attempting to use 20 without proper derivation is illegal and leads to dead ends.\n\n4. **Focus on valid combinations:**\n   - Combining 4 and 5: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n   - Using 6 and 10 with 20: consider operations like 20 + 4, 20 + 6, or dividing, but only if valid.\n\n5. **Be cautious",

Immediate victory moves, such as 4 \u00d7 6 = 24, are highly promising, as they directly solve the puzzle. Moves that reduce the number of remaining options while maintaining valid operations help steer toward solutions efficiently.\n\nFrom the recent attempt, several insights emerge. First, intermediate results must be tracked carefully: any new number created from an operation becomes part of the remaining set, replacing the original operands. For example, if 4 and 5 are combined to produce 20, then 20 replaces 4 and 5 in the set, leaving {20, 6, 10}. Subsequent operations must use only these available numbers, and no intermediate value should be reused improperly. Second, it's crucial to verify that each step employs only current, legitimate values\u2014avoiding any reuse of intermediate results unless explicitly reintroduced. Third, operations that attempt to use values not derived legitimately (e.g., reusing a value already consumed, or creating a value outside the current set) are invalid.\n\nTherefore, an effective evaluation model emphasizes: (1) verifying the legality of each move by ensuring only available numbers"

From here, avoid reusing or invalidly combining numbers. For example, after obtaining 4 from 10\u22126, recognize that the remaining numbers are 4 and 5. Combining these, **4 + 5 = 9**, or **4 \u00d7 5 = 20**, are useful intermediate steps.

The core principle is to prioritize operations that directly advance toward forming 24 or produce intermediate results close to it. Moves that generate values near 24\u2014such as 20, 16, 18, or 22\u2014are promising, as they provide manageable pathways to reach the target through subsequent operations. Conversely, results far from 24 (e.g., 0, 2, 30) are less promising, especially if they complicate the path to 24 or involve overly complex calculations.\n\nOperations should only involve the original numbers without reuse or referencing numbers not present initially. Valid moves include addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, provided they produce feasible intermediate totals. For example, subtracting 6 from 10 to get 4 is promising because it simplifies the set and retains the potential to reach 24 efficiently. Conversely, attempts to produce results like 20 from 10 and 5 (via multiplication) are promising, but forming impossible or redundant intermediate values (like repeatedly using the same number without proper replacement) diminishes move quality.\n\nIn the specific context of 4, 5, 6, and 10, moves that replace two numbers with their combined result should always be validated for legality: they must use original numbers, avoid reuse, and produce"

                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 24 game for the numbers 4, 5, 6, and 10, it is crucial to focus on the legality, efficiency, and proximity to the target 24. Valid moves must involve only the original numbers without reuse or referencing invalid intermediate results. Operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014are promising when they produce intermediate values near 24, such as 20, 16, 18, or 22, as these values facilitate straightforward paths to 24. Conversely, results far from 24, like 0, 2, or 30, indicate less promising moves due to increased complexity or dead ends.\n\nWhen combining two numbers, the move's value depends on whether it simplifies the remaining set toward 24. For instance, reducing larger numbers or creating intermediate totals close to 24 is advantageous. Moves that produce impossible or invalid results\u2014such as referencing numbers outside the"
