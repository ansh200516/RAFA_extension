Directly using 5 and 4 in multiplication is promising (e.g., 5\u00d74=20), but verify if such straightforward steps are permitted or deemed invalid in your specific puzzle rules. Since the previous attempt flagged \"5\u00d74\" as invalid, consider alternative approaches: explore combining 6 and 10 with addition or subtraction to reach 16 or 14, then adjust with division or subtraction to hit 24 (e.g., 6+10=16; 16+6=22; 22+2=24). Alternatively, look for ways to create intermediate targets: for instance, 6\u00d74=24 directly if 4 is available, but here 4 is only one of the initial numbers. Combining 10",

Do not reuse a number or perform an operation involving numbers not present in the current set. Each move reduces the count of numbers by one, progressing toward a single value.\n\n2. **Focus on Creating Intermediate Targets Close to 24:**  \nAim to generate intermediate results such as 12, 16, 20, or 24 through simple operations. These serve as stepping stones to reach 24 via addition or division.\n\n3. **Prioritize Multiplication of Small Numbers for Larger Results:**  \nMultiplying smaller pairs (like 4\u00d75=20, or 6\u00d74=24) is often promising. However, be mindful of the rules around combining numbers and ensure the sequence of moves remains valid.\n\n4. **Utilize Addition and Subtraction to Adjust Results:**  \nUse addition to combine small numbers into larger totals, and subtraction to fine-tune values. Be cautious with subtraction to avoid negative results unless they can be used advantageously.\n\n**Specific Application to 4, 5, 6, 10:**\n\n- **Step 1: Avoid invalid moves like directly subtracting or dividing using numbers no longer in the current set.**  \nFor example, attempting \"10 - 4 = 6\" is valid in terms of operation, but if the move is performed improperly (e.g., using numbers not in the current set or dropping numbers), it becomes invalid. Remember, after combining 10 and 4, the set updates to {5, 6, 6}, not left with the original 4 or 10 separately.\n\n- **Step 2: Generate intermediate targets with valid operations.**  \nFor instance, combine 4 and 5 to get 20:  \n`4 \u00d7 5 = 20`  \nRemaining set: {6, 10, 20}\n\nNext, look to combine 6 and 10:  \n`6 + 10 = 16`  \nRemaining",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves for the 4, 5, 6, 10 puzzle, it\u2019s crucial to prioritize operations that systematically reduce the set toward the target 24, while avoiding steps that produce impossible or invalid residues. Valid moves must combine two current numbers into a new number, replacing the used pair, and conform to the rule that each number is used exactly once per operation. Moves that produce residues like 20 or 24 directly are promising, as they indicate progress toward the goal. Conversely, steps that generate residues such as 20 (which are not easily reachable from subsequent operations) should be avoided, as they often lead to dead ends. The recent attempt highlights that invalid moves\u2014such as reusing numbers without proper replacement\u2014are counterproductive; in particular, operations must be performed on the current set, not referencing original numbers outside the current context. Consequently, the evaluation model emphasizes selecting moves that"

Do not use any number more than once per move. After each operation, verify the set updates correctly\u2014no introducing or removing numbers out of sequence. For example, combining 10 and 6 yields 4, leaving the set {4, 5, 4}\u2014this is valid only if the result replaces the two selected numbers correctly.\n\n2. **Leverage Multiplication of Small Numbers for Larger Results:**  \nCreating 20 or 24 early simplifies reaching 24. Notably, 4\u00d75=20 is straightforward, and then combining 20 with 4 (from earlier step) or 6 can help reach 24. For instance:  \n`4 \u00d7 5 = 20` (set: 6, 10, 20)  \nThen, attempt to combine 20 and 4 (if a 4 exists) or find alternative routes.\n\n3. **Generate Intermediate Targets Close to 24:**  \nAim for intermediate results like 12, 16, or 20. For example, adding 6 + 10 = 16 helps create a step toward 24 via division or subtraction.\n\n4. **Avoid Invalid Moves Like Using Non-Existing Numbers or Misinterpreting Set Changes:**  \nFrom the recent attempt, note that operations like `10 - 6 = 4` are valid mathematically but must be performed on current set members to produce a valid new set.

Moves producing residues like 20 or 24 are promising if they lead closer to the goal, but steps resulting in impossible sets\u2014such as duplicates or invalid residues\u2014should be avoided.

Strictly Use Available Numbers at Each Step:  \nEnsure each operation involves only the current set of numbers. Do not reuse or drop numbers unless they are explicitly combined and replaced in the set. For example, if you combine 4 and 6 to get 10, replace those two with 10, and proceed with the updated set. This prevents invalid operations like reusing the same number repeatedly or ignoring numbers.\n\n2. Generate Valid Intermediate Targets Near 24:  \nAim to produce intermediate values like 12, 16, or 20, which can be combined to reach 24 efficiently. For instance, combining 4 and 6 to make 24 directly is not possible, but creating 20 (via 4\u00d75) or 16 (via 10 + 6) provides stepping stones. Recognizing that 4\u00d75=20 is a strong move, since 20 + 4 or 20 + 6 can reach 24 using existing numbers.\n\n3. Prioritize Multiplication of Smaller Numbers to Approach 24:  \nMultiplying 4 and 5 yields 20, which is close to 24. Having 20 allows for an easy addition (+4 or +6) to reach 24. Similarly, generating 12 (e.g., 6\u00d72, if 2 were available) or combining 10 and 6 to get 16 can offer alternative pathways, but with only 4, 5, 6, and ",
