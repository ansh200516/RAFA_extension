Focus on operations involving 11 and 10 to generate intermediate results closer to 24.\n\n2. Use subtraction or division to create smaller, more manageable numbers from larger pairs. For example, subtract 5 from 11 to get 6, which can serve as a versatile intermediate.\n\n3. Leverage the remaining smaller numbers (1, 5, or 10) in combination with generated intermediates. For instance, after obtaining 6, consider multiplying or adding with 1 or 5 to approach 24.\n\n4. Aim for sequences like (11 - 5) = 6, then multiply by 4 (which can be obtained by combining other numbers) or add 10 or 1 strategically to reach 24.\n\n5. When combining, ensure each step uses only the remaining original numbers or results from previous valid operations, maintaining legality and progress toward 24.\n\n6.

Since direct operations with 11 and 10 can produce intermediate targets conducive to reaching 24, consider combining these first. For example, instead of subtracting 5 from 11, which leads to 6 (and was shown to be unhelpful in previous attempts), explore alternative operations involving 11 and 10 that produce multiples or sums closer to 24.\n\nPrioritize adding or multiplying 10 and 11 to generate intermediate results near 24. For instance, 10 + 11 = 21, which is close to 24; then, adding 1 yields 22, still short\u2014so look for ways to bridge the gap by incorporating 5 or 1 into multiplication or division. Multiplying 5 by 4 (which can be obtained by combining 10 and 1) yields 20; adding 4 gives 24, but creating 4 from remaining numbers is key.\n\nAvoid operations that produce dead ends, like subtracting 5 from 11 to get 6, which doesn't lead to 24. Instead, consider dividing 10 by 5 to get 2, then multiplying by 11 to get 22, and adding 1 to reach 23, still short\u2014so adjust accordingly.\n\nUse the",

Instead of subtracting 5 from 11 (which yields unhelpful results), consider dividing or multiplying to produce intermediate values near 24. For instance, dividing 10 by 5 gives 2, and multiplying by 11 yields 22; adding 1 then reaches 23, still short of 24. Alternatively, multiplying 5 by 2 (obtained from dividing 10 by 5) gives 10, which can be combined with other operations.\n\nAvoid invalid steps like using numbers not present in the initial set\u2014such as creating 2 from nowhere.

Recognize that dividing 10 by 5 yields 2, a useful factor for reaching 24 through multiplication. Simultaneously, combining 11 and 1 to get 12 creates a multiple of 12, which pairs well with 2. The key is to generate 12 and 2 from the original set and multiply them: (10 \u00f7 5) \u00d7 (11 + 1) = 2 \u00d7 12 = 24. This approach avoids unnecessary steps, ensures all operations are valid, and maintains the integrity of the initial numbers.\n\nAvoid steps that introduce numbers not in the original set, such as dividing 12 by 12 when 12 isn't initially available. Instead, focus on forming 12 by adding 11 and 1, which are present, or other combinations that stay within the provided numbers. Remember that combining 10 and 5 through division or multiplication can lead to useful intermediate totals, but avoid overcomplicating with extr",

Moves that produce intermediate results closer to 24\u2014such as summing larger pairs (e.g., 10 + 11 = 21) or reducing numbers effectively\u2014are promising. Prioritize combining larger numbers first to quickly narrow the search space, but only through valid operations that utilize the original set without introducing extraneous values. Invalid moves\u2014such as attempting to use a number not present in the initial set or performing operations that generate unsupported intermediate results\u2014are unpromising and should be avoided.

Past attempts highlight the importance of respecting the rule that each step must use existing numbers and produce intermediate results that are part of the current set, not new arbitrary numbers.\n\nKey insights for this puzzle:\n\n1. **Avoid invalid operations that produce extraneous numbers:** For example, multiplying two 4s to get 16 is valid mathematically but invalid in the game context if it results in a number not present in the current set. After such an operation, only the remaining original numbers or their valid results can be used; you cannot treat 16 as an original number or combine it further unless explicitly derived from current numbers.\n\n2. **Prioritize combining the larger numbers first:** Use 8 with 4 to generate simpler intermediate results (like 8 - 4 = 4 or 8 / 4 = 2). This reduces complexity and keeps the set manageable.\n\n3. **Leverage the repeated 4s to create 8:** Since 4 + 4 = 8 is a straightforward way to combine the two 4s, producing an 8 that can then be combined with the remaining 1 to reach 24.\n\n4. **Construct 24 through",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves for the set 1, 4, 4, 8, the key is assessing legality and the potential to approach 24 efficiently. Valid moves should use each number exactly once and adhere to allowed operations. Combining identical numbers (like 4 and 4) is permissible only if the move is valid and follows game rules; for example, multiplying 4 * 4 = 16 is legal, but the move must be properly justified. Moves that reuse or manipulate numbers in ways inconsistent with initial availability\u2014such as using a number not present or exceeding counts\u2014are invalid. Effective strategies prioritize combining larger numbers early to reduce the problem size while maintaining legal operations."

Past attempts reveal that trying to generate numbers outside the current set\u2014such as doubling an 8 to get 16\u2014violates these rules, leading to invalid moves. Therefore, the strategy should focus on combining the original numbers through legal operations to reach 24.\n\nFirst, leverage the repeated 4s to create 8 by combining them via addition: 4 + 4 = 8. This step is straightforward and legal, as it uses only the original numbers. Once you have two 8s, you might consider combining these to reach 16; however, this is invalid unless both 8s are explicitly present at that point. Since the initial set contains only one 8, combining it with another 8 (created by adding the two 4s) is permissible if you have already combined the 4s into 8; then, combining the 8s to get 16 is legal if both are available.\n\nNext, explore pairing 8 with 1 to produce 9 (via 8 + 1), which leaves 4 and 4 untouched. From there, the key is to form 24 by combining these intermediate results. For example, after obtaining 8 (from 4 + 4), and 1, you can attempt operations like multiplying 8 by 3 (which can be formed by 4 - 1), but this involves multiple steps and potential rule violations if not managed carefully.\n\nAn effective approach is to focus on creating intermediate numbers that combine neatly into 24. For example",

Valid moves must adhere strictly to available numbers, avoiding reuse of a number beyond its initial count\u2014using 8 + 8 is invalid since only one 8 exists. Combining larger numbers early can help reduce problem complexity but must be done legally; for instance, multiplying 4 * 4 = 16 is permissible, but creating invalid sums like 8 + 8 is not. Moves that merge numbers should aim to produce intermediate results closer to 24 while preserving options for final steps. Repeatedly attempting invalid operations or misusing numbers\u2014such as adding the same number twice when only one exists\u2014leads to dead ends. When a move is invalid, the remaining set of numbers should be reassessed based on actual available values, guiding subsequent strategies. Effective evaluation involves confirming each move's legality and considering whether the resulting numbers can logically reach 24 within the game's operational constraints. Moves that do"

Avoid creating or assuming numbers outside the current set. For example, do not double 8 to get 16 unless explicitly combining the present 8s.\n\n2. **Leverage the Repeated 4s to Create 8:**  \nCombine the two 4s via addition:  \n`4 + 4 = 8`  \nThis yields an additional 8, giving two 8s in the process. Use this to facilitate multiplication or division operations that approach 24.\n\n3. **Use Division to Simplify and Generate Useful Intermediate Results:**  \nFrom the previous step, dividing 8 by 1 is valid and produces 8:  \n`8 / 1 = 8`  \nThis operation is confirmed as legal and helps manipulate the numbers toward 24.\n\n4. **Avoid Invalid Operations that Increase Number Count or Use Non-Current Numbers:**  \nFor example, dividing 8 by 4 to get 2 may seem straightforward, but in the context of the game, if this step results in more leftover numbers than the rules allow, it\u2019s invalid. The previous attempt identified dividing 8 by 4 as illegal in that context because it left inconsistent numbers.\n\n5. **Focus on Combining Results to Reach 24:**  \nUse multiplication of intermediate results, such as pairing 8 and ",

Moves must use each number exactly once, respecting their counts\u2014no reuse of a single 8 or 4 beyond their initial presence. Valid operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but only when they produce results consistent with the actual remaining numbers. For instance, combining 4 and 4 into 16 is permissible, whereas attempting to use 8 + 8 is invalid since only one 8 exists. Early operations that reduce larger numbers can simplify subsequent steps, but only if they are legal and produce intermediate results closer to 24. Moves that involve invalid operations\u2014like dividing by zero, creating impossible sums, or reusing numbers\u2014must be avoided, as they lead to dead ends or misrepresent the current state. After each move, reassess the remaining numbers carefully, ensuring the counts and values match the actual"

Use this to facilitate multiplication or division toward 24.\n\n2. **Leverage the Existing 8 and Create Intermediate Values:**  \nFrom the original 8, consider dividing it by 1:  \n`8 / 1 = 8`  \nThis step is legal, retains the 8, and can help structure the calculation.\n\n3. **Avoid Dividing 8 by 4 in a Way That Leaves Inconsistent Numbers:**  \nDividing 8 by 4 produces 2, but from previous attempts, this step led to a dead end because subsequent operations on 2 and remaining 4s do not yield 24. Therefore, avoid using `8 / 4` if it leaves unresolved obstacles.\n\n4. **Focus on Combining Results to Reach 24 Efficiently:**  \nAfter creating two 8s (via `4 + 4`) and possibly dividing 8 by 1, look for multiplication combinations:  \n- Multiply 8 by 3 (if obtainable), or  \n- Use the remaining 4s to generate 12 (via `4 * 3`) and then multiply by 2, or  \n- Recognize that with the current numbers, forming 24 directly from 8 and 3 is promising",

Combining larger numbers early can simplify subsequent steps, but only if the resulting intermediate is closer to 24 and achievable within the remaining options. Moves that produce impossible results, such as dividing by zero or creating invalid sums, should be avoided. After each move, carefully reassess remaining numbers, ensuring the counts and values are accurate. Recognize that certain combinations"

Combining larger numbers early can streamline progress, but only if the resulting intermediate remains closer to 24 and does not compromise future options. For example, adding the two 4s to form 8 is advantageous, as it simplifies the set to 8 and 1, preserving potential pathways. Moves that produce invalid results\u2014such as dividing by zero, repeating numbers improperly, or creating sums incompatible with remaining options\u2014should be avoided. After each move, reassess the remaining numbers, ensuring counts and values are accurate, and evaluate whether the new set can feasibly reach 24. In this context, forming 8 from 4 + 4 is promising, but subsequent attempts\u2014like combining 8 and 1\u2014must be scrutinized for legality and strategic"

The main challenge lies in selecting operations that are both legal and strategically productive, minimizing unnecessary complexity or illegal steps.\n\n**1. Prioritize Using the Two 4s to Generate a Useful Intermediate**\n\nThe most straightforward and reliable approach involves combining the two 4s early in the process. Since addition and multiplication are simple, legal, and reversible, they provide easy pathways:\n\n- **Addition:** `4 + 4 = 8`  \n  This results in an 8, which pairs naturally with the remaining 8, enabling straightforward multiplication to reach 24.\n\n- **Multiplication:** `4 * 4 = 16`  \n  Produces a larger number, which can be combined with 8 or 1. Although more complex, it offers alternative routes to reach 24.\n\nFocusing on addition (`4 + 4 = 8`) simplifies subsequent steps because it produces a number identical to the remaining 8, creating a direct path via multiplication: `8 * 3 = 24`. To generate 3, use the remaining 1 and 4:\n\n**2. Generating the Number 3 Using Remaining Numbers**\n\nFrom the leftover 1 and 4, a straightforward way to get 3 is:\n\n- `4 - 1 = 3` \u2014 a legal and simple operation.\n\nOnce you have 3, multiply it by 8 (from `4 + 4`) to reach:\n\n- `8 * 3 = 24`\n\n**3. Implementation of the Strategy**\n\nPutting the steps together:\n\n- **Step 1:** Combine the two 4s with addition:  \n  `4 + 4 = 8`  \n  Remaining numbers: 8, 1.\n\n- **Step 2:** Use the remaining 1 and 4 (not yet used) to produce 3:  \n  `4 - 1 = 3`  \n\n- **Step 3:** Multiply the 8 (from Step 1) by 3:  \n  `8 * 3 = 24`\n\n- **Step 4:** Finalize by confirming no other numbers are left unused.\n\nThis sequence is fully legal, uses each number exactly once, and achieves 24 efficiently.\n\n**4. Avoiding Illegal or Inefficient Steps**\n\nPast attempts that failed involved illegal operations such as reusing results improperly or dropping numbers without proper operations. For example, multiplying 4 * 4 to get 16 and then attempting to combine it with 8 or 1 in a way that reuses or drops numbers improperly leads to invalid steps.\n\nTo prevent such issues:\n\n- Always track which",

Past attempts reveal that early combination of the 4s simplifies the pathway toward 24, especially when using straightforward operations like addition and multiplication. Additionally, considering the sequence of operations and ensuring legality at each step prevents invalid moves and dead-ends.\n\n**Key Insights from Previous Attempts:**\n\n- Combining the two 4s early is most productive, either via addition (`4 + 4 = 8`) or multiplication (`4 * 4 = 16`). Addition yields an 8, directly matching the remaining 8, facilitating a simple multiplication to reach 24 (`8 * 3`).  \n- To generate 3 from the remaining numbers, subtracting 1 from 4 (`4 - 1 = 3`) is a straightforward and legal operation.  \n- Using the combined 8 from the two 4s and the 3 from the subtraction, multiply (`8 * 3 = 24`) to achieve the target.\n\nThis approach minimizes complexity, adheres strictly to legal operations, and ensures each number is used exactly once.\n\n**Incorporating New Learning:**\n\nFrom recent attempts, a common pitfall involves misusing numbers after an operation, especially dividing or combining in ways that violate the rules\u2014such as reusing results improperly or dropping numbers without valid operations. For example, dividing 8 by 4 to get 2 is legal, but subsequent steps must then correctly incorporate this 2 into the remaining calculations. Using the resulting 2 to reach 24 requires careful planning: multiplying it by 8 or 4, or combining with other results, must be done legally and logically.\n\n**Refined, Concise Strategy:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining the Two 4s Early:**\n\n   - Use addition: `4 + 4 = 8`  \n     Remaining numbers: 8, 1  \n   - Or multiplication: `4 * 4 = 16` (less straightforward but possible)\n\n2. **Generate a Useful Intermediate:**\n\n   - Using addition (`4 + 4 = 8`) yields an 8 identical to the remaining 8, enabling a straightforward multiplication: `8 * 3 =",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves for the 1, 4, 4, 8 puzzle within the Game of 24, it is crucial to develop a structured approach that emphasizes legality, strategic simplification, and future feasibility. The core principles are as follows:\n\n1. Legality:  \n- All moves must adhere strictly to game rules: each number can only be used once per move, and only permitted operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are allowed.  \n- Moves must avoid illegal actions such as division by zero or producing non-permissible intermediate values (e.g., fractions or negative numbers unless part of valid intermediate steps).  \n- After each move, the set of remaining numbers must be updated correctly, ensuring no numbers are reused or dropped improperly. The move's validity hinges on consistent use of current numbers.\n\n2. Strategic Simplification:  \n- Moves should aim to reduce the complexity of the current set, ideally consolidating multiple numbers into fewer, more manageable values. For example, combining the two 4s via 4 + 4 = 8 simplifies the set from four to three numbers, maintaining options toward 24.  \n- Operations that produce intermediate values closer to 24 are more promising, but only if they preserve the ability to reach 24 in subsequent steps. For instance, multiplying 4 and 8 to get 32 might be less promising unless subsequent moves can bring the total back toward 24.  \n- Combining high-value numbers (like 8) with others should be evaluated based on whether resulting intermediate values can logically lead to 24.\n\n"

Past successful attempts reveal that combining the 4s via addition (`4 + 4 = 8`) or multiplication (`4 * 4 = 16`) is most productive, as these produce manageable intermediate results closely related to 24.\n\nA particularly effective approach is to combine the two 4s with addition first, producing an 8. This aligns neatly with the remaining 8, enabling a straightforward multiplication to reach 24 (`8 * 3`). To get the 3, subtracting 1 from 4 (`4 - 1 = 3`) is simple, legal, and uses the remaining number without complication. This sequence\u2014adding the 4s to get 8, subtracting 1 to get 3, then multiplying the two 8s\u2014directly yields 24.\n\nHowever, recent attempts highlight the importance of strict operation legality and correct number management. For example, dividing 8 by 4 to get 2 is legal, but subsequent steps must incorporate this 2 correctly, ensuring no reuse or dropping of numbers improperly. If after dividing 8 by 4 you are left with numbers 1, 2, and 4, then trying to reach 24 is problematic because combinations like `4 * 4 * 1.5` are invalid due to the fractional 1.5, which isn\u2019t available. Similarly, attempts to multiply these remaining numbers to reach 24 often fail because the necessary factors aren\u2019t present or the sequence is invalid.\n\nFrom the most recent analysis, a critical insight is that certain operations, while legal, don\u2019t lead to a solution\u2014particularly if they don\u2019t set up the remaining numbers for a straightforward combination toward 24. For example, dividing 8 by 4 to get 2 leaves the remaining numbers 1 and 4, which don\u2019t combine multiplicatively to 24 in a simple, legal way.\n\nTherefore, the best, concise strategy for this puzzle is:\n\n1. **Combine the two 4s early",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 1, 4, 4, 8 Puzzle in the Game of 24\n\nWhen assessing moves within the set {1, 4, 4, 8}, it is essential to prioritize legality, strategic reduction, and ensuring the potential to reach 24 in subsequent steps. The core principles are:\n\n**1. Legality of Moves:**  \n- Every operation must strictly conform to game rules: each number can only be used once per move, and only permitted operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are allowable.  \n- Moves must avoid illegal actions such as division by zero or producing invalid intermediate values (like fractions or negatives unless justified within valid intermediate steps).  \n- After each move, the resulting set of numbers must accurately reflect the usage of initial numbers\u2014no number should be reused improperly, dropped without justification, or created out of thin air.  \n- In the context of the current sequence: transforming {1, 4, 4, 8} into {1, 2, 8} was valid if it involved dividing 8 by 4 to get 2, using existing numbers correctly.\n\n**2. Strategic Simplification and Value Progression:**  \n- Moves should aim to reduce the complexity of the current set, ideally consolidating multiple numbers into fewer, more manageable values. For example, combining the two 4s via 4 + 4 = 8 simplifies the set from four to three numbers, maintaining a clear path toward 24.  \n- Operations that produce intermediate values closer to 24 are more promising, provided they do not compromise the ability to reach"

Combining the 4s via addition (`4 + 4 = 8`) or multiplication (`4 * 4 = 16`) is most productive, as these produce manageable results close to 24. \n\nA highly effective approach is to add the two 4s first, creating an 8. This aligns with the existing 8, enabling a straightforward multiplication: `8 * 3 = 24`. To obtain 3, subtract 1 from 4 (`4 - 1 = 3`), utilizing the remaining 1 without complication. The sequence is:\n\n- Combine 4 + 4 = 8\n- Subtract 1 from 4: 4 - 1 = 3\n- Multiply the two 8s: 8 * 3 = 24\n\nThis method is both concise and relies solely on legal operations, avoiding unnecessary complexities.\n\nAlternatively, consider dividing the 8 by 4 to get 2 (`8 / 4 = 2`). The remaining numbers would be 1, 4, and 2. To reach 24 from these, multiply 4 and 2: `4 * 2 = 8`, and then multiply by 3, which is obtained by subtracting 1 from 4 (`4 - 1 = 3`).

If the move combines two numbers into a new value, the original numbers used should be considered consumed, and the new value should replace those in subsequent calculations. Reusing or dropping numbers without proper justification violates the integrity of the process. For instance, attempting to generate 16 from 8 + 8 when only one 8 exists is invalid; the set remains {1, 4, 4, 8} if such an operation is attempted.\n\n**3.

The initial summary emphasized combining the two 4s\u2014either via addition (`4 + 4 = 8`) or multiplication (`4 * 4 = 16`)\u2014to produce intermediate results close to 24, and then using the remaining numbers to bridge the gap.\n\nRecent analysis highlights the importance of tracking the legality of operations and the current remaining numbers after each step. For example, starting with the operation `8 / 4 = 2` is valid and reduces the problem to the numbers 8, 1, and 2. This sequence is straightforward and uses only permitted operations without reusing or dropping numbers improperly.\n\nFrom this point, the challenge is to combine the remaining numbers\u20148, 1, and 2\u2014to reach 24. Recognizing that `8 * 3 = 24`, the key is to generate 3 from the remaining numbers.

The combined insights from previous summaries and recent feedback highlight core principles that ensure moves are both legal and strategically sound. This model aims to distill those principles into a concise, practical framework for evaluating promising steps towards reaching 24 effectively.\n\n**1. Strict Adherence to Operation Legality**\n\nEvery move must conform precisely to the game's fundamental rules. These rules specify that:\n\n- Each number can only be used once per move. Reusing a number multiple times without explicit allowance is invalid.\n- Allowed operations are addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7).\n- Operations must be mathematically valid: division by zero is forbidden; fractional or negative intermediate results are permissible only if justified by the context and consistent with the rules.\n- No creation of new numbers outside the allowed operations and initial set.\n\n*Implication:* Before executing a move, verify that it uses only available numbers, that each number is used once, and that the operation is mathematically valid.\n\n**2. Accurate Tracking of Number Usage and Set Updates**\n\nPost-move, the set of remaining numbers must be updated precisely to reflect the operation performed:\n\n- When combining two numbers, remove those original numbers from the set.\n- Introduce the new result of the operation into the set.\n- Do not arbitrarily drop or reuse numbers unless explicitly justified, ensuring the set always accurately represents the current state.\n- Maintain clarity on which numbers are available at each step to prevent invalid reuse.\n\n*Implication:* This careful bookkeeping ensures each move is legitimate and maintains the integrity of the puzzle state, preventing illegal moves such as creating 16 from a single 8.\n\n**3. Strategic Simplification and Value Progression**\n\nMoves should be selected to progressively simplify the problem or steer it toward the target (24):\n\n- Prefer combining numbers to reduce complexity, such as consolidating multiple small numbers into larger or more useful intermediate values.\n- Seek operations that move the set closer to 24, such as multiplying smaller numbers or adding to reach intermediate benchmarks.\n- Recognize that not all immediate moves are promising; some may complicate the path or lead to dead ends.\n\n*Implication:* Prioritize moves that streamline the route to 24, avoiding unnecessary complexity or detours.\n\n**4. Recognizing Valid and Invalid Steps Based on Feedback**\n\nRecent feedback indicates that some moves, though seemingly logical, violate rules\u2014such as reusing a value (e.g., attempting to generate 16 by doing 8 + "

Past attempts reveal that initial manipulations involving division and multiplication often simplify the problem and open pathways to the target.\n\n**Key Lessons from Previous Attempts**\n\n1. **Early Division to Simplify:**  \n   Using division to reduce larger numbers or generate manageable intermediate results is effective. For example, `8 / 4 = 2` simplifies the problem by producing 2, which can then be combined with other numbers to reach 24.\n\n2. **Avoid Using Multiple Operations Prematurely:**  \n   Combining all numbers with multiple steps before establishing a clear pathway can lead to invalid or impossible formulas. For example, multiplying two 4s immediately (`4 * 4 = 16`) is valid, but subsequent steps must be carefully planned to avoid invalid operations or dropping numbers.\n\n3. **Tracking Remaining Numbers Carefully:**  \n   After each operation, keep track of which numbers remain. This ensures operations are valid and no numbers are reused or omitted improperly.\n\n4. **Generating 3 from Remaining Numbers:**  \n   Since 24 can be obtained via `8 * 3`, generating 3 from the remaining numbers (1, 4, or 2) is a promising approach. Notably, `2 + 1 = 3` is straightforward if the intermediate 2 is available.\n\n**Step-by-Step Strategy for the Current Puzzle**\n\n- **Step 1: Use division to produce 2**  \n  `8 / 4 = 2`  \n  Remaining numbers: 4, 1, and 2 (from the original set, with one 4 used up)\n\n- **Step 2: Generate 3 from remaining numbers**  \n  `2 + 1 = 3`  \n  Remaining numbers: 4 and 3\n\n- **Step 3: Multiply 8 and 3 to reach 24**  \n  `8 * 3 = 24`  \n  Final result achieved.\n\nThis sequence is valid because:\n- Each operation uses only the available numbers.\n- No number is reused or omitted improperly.\n- Operations conform to standard rules.\n\n**Alternative Approaches**\n\n- Use `4 + 4 = 8`, then combine",

Drawing from previous insights and recent feedback, the following principles form a concise, practical model for assessing promising steps toward reaching 24 efficiently and legally.\n\n**1. Strict Adherence to Operation Legality**\n\nEvery move must strictly conform to the game's fundamental rules:\n\n- **Use of Numbers:** Each initial number (1, 4, 4, 8) can only be used once per move. Reusing the same number multiple times without explicit allowance is invalid.\n- **Allowed Operations:** Only addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7) are permitted. Operations must be mathematically valid: division by zero is forbidden, and fractional or negative intermediate results are acceptable only if justified within the move sequence and in accordance with the rules.\n- **No External Number Creation:** Moves must not generate new numbers outside the allowed operations and initial set. For example, creating 16 from 8 + 8 is invalid unless both 8s are present, and their use is properly accounted for.\n\n*Implication:* Before executing any move, verify that it uses only available numbers, each exactly once per move, and that the operation is valid. This ensures legal moves and prevents attempts based on invalid assumptions.\n\n**2. Accurate Tracking of Number Usage and Set Updates**\n\nPost-move, the current set of numbers must be meticulously updated:\n\n- **Removal of Used Numbers:** When combining two numbers, remove those original values from the set.\n- **Addition of Result:** Insert the new result of the operation into the set.\n- **Consistency:** Do not arbitrarily discard or reuse numbers; ensure the set accurately reflects the current state after each move.\n\nFor example, when performing 4 \u00d7 4 = 16, remove both 4s and add 16, updating the set accordingly. This precise bookkeeping prevents illegal reuse, such as attempting to generate 16 from a single 8 or reusing numbers multiple times without justification.\n\n*Implication:* Clear, consistent tracking of the current set of numbers after each move guarantees move legitimacy and logical progression toward 24.\n\n**3.

The key is to produce a 3 or a 6 early in the process, as these facilitate straightforward pathways to 24 via multiplication.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Early Division to Simplify:**  \n   Using division early\u2014such as `8 / 4 = 2`\u2014reduces larger numbers to manageable smaller values, creating opportunities to combine with remaining numbers effectively.\n\n2. **Generate 3 or 6 as Critical Intermediates:**  \n   Since 24 = 8 * 3 or 6 * 4, producing either 3 or 6 from the remaining numbers simplifies the final step. For example, combining 2 + 1 yields 3, which is central in multiplying to reach 24.\n\n3. **Careful Tracking of Remaining Numbers:**  \n   After each operation, ensure that only the used numbers are combined and that no number is reused or omitted improperly. Valid sequences involve sequential operations that utilize each number exactly once.\n\n4. **Avoid Premature, Unplanned Operations:**  \n   Combining all numbers without a clear pathway often leads to dead ends. Focus on operations that produce intermediate results close to 24 before final multiplication.\n\n**Practical Application:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Use division to generate 2:  \n  `8 / 4 = 2`  \n  Remaining numbers: 4, 1, and 2 (from the original set, with one 4 used).\n\n- **Step 2:** Generate 3 from remaining numbers:  \n  `2 + 1 = 3`  \n  Remaining numbers: 4 and 3.\n\n- **Step 3:** Multiply 8 (original number) by 3 to reach 24:  \n  `8 * 3 = 24`  \n\nThis sequence is valid because:  \n- All used numbers are accounted",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 1, 4, 4, 8 Puzzle in the Game of 24\n\nTo effectively solve the set {1, 4, 4, 8} in the Game of 24, it is essential to develop a rigorous, rule-compliant evaluation framework that guides move selection and assesses their promise. Building upon previous insights and recent feedback, the following principles distill core lessons into a concise, practical model tailored for this specific puzzle.\n\n**1. Enforce Strict Legality of Operations**\n\nEvery move must adhere to the game's fundamental rules:\n\n- **Use of Numbers:** Each initial number (1, 4, 4, 8) can be used only once per move. Reusing the same number multiple times without explicit permission is invalid.\n- **Allowed Operations:** Only addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7) are permitted. Each operation must be mathematically valid; division by zero is forbidden. Intermediate results may be fractional or negative if justified within the move sequence and compliant with the rules.\n- **No External Number Generation:** Moves must not produce numbers outside the initial set unless explicitly created through valid operations, and each use must be properly tracked. For example, creating 16 by adding 8 + 8 is valid only if both 8s are present and properly used.\n\n*Implication:* Before executing a move, verify that it uses only available numbers, each exactly once per move, and that the operation is valid. This prevents invalid moves based on incorrect assumptions about number usage.\n\n**2. Precise Tracking of Number Usage and Set Updates**\n\nPost-move, the current set of numbers must be updated with meticulous accuracy:\n\n- **Remove Used Numbers:** When combining two numbers, remove those original values from the set.\n- **Add Resulting Number:** Insert the new result of the operation into the set.\n- **Maintain Consistency:** Do not discard or reuse numbers arbitrarily. Ensure the set reflects exactly the current state after each move.\n\nFor example, performing 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 involves removing both 4s and adding 16. This prevents illegal reuse or overuse of initial numbers, ensuring each step progresses legitimately toward the target.\n\n*Implication:* Clear, consistent bookkeeping guarantees move legitimacy and logical progress, avoiding errors that could invalidate the solution path.\n\n**3. Value Progression and Strategic Simplification**\n\nMoves should be evaluated based on their contribution toward reaching 24:\n\n- **Aim for Progress:** Prefer moves that produce intermediate results closer"

Recent attempts highlight common pitfalls\u2014most notably, forming intermediate results like 16 without explicitly deriving them from the original numbers, and then attempting to operate on these intermediate results as if they were original numbers. This approach is invalid because each step must strictly use only the numbers available after previous operations, and intermediate results are not part of the original set.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n1. **Use the original numbers precisely once per operation:**  \n   Any intermediate value (like 16) must be explicitly formed from available numbers before being used in further steps. Skipping this verification leads to invalid sequences.\n\n2. **Prioritize operations that produce 3 or 6 early:**  \n   Since 24 factors into 6\u00d74 or 8\u00d73, generating these intermediates early in the process simplifies the final step. For example, creating a 3 allows for straightforward multiplication to reach 24.\n\n3. **Leverage division strategically to create manageable numbers:**  \n   Dividing 8 by 4 yields 2, a useful component for forming 3 (via 2+1), which is central in reaching 24.\n\n4. **Avoid dropping or reusing numbers improperly:**  \n   Every number must be accounted for in each step; do not assume values like 16 exist unless explicitly constructed.\n\n5. **Construct intermediate results explicitly from the initial set:**  \n   For example, to get 16, use 4\u00d74; to get 3, combine 2+1, after producing 2 from 8/4.\n\n**Application to the current puzzle:**\n\nA valid, step-by-step solution should look like this:\n\n- **Step 1:** Use the two 4s to form 16  \n  `4 \u00d7 4 = 16`  \n  Remaining numbers: 8, 1, and the intermediate 16\n\n- **Step 2:** Use 8 and 2 (obtained from `8 / 4 = 2`) to approach",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 1, 4, 4, 8 Puzzle in the Game of 24\n\nIn approaching the puzzle with initial numbers 1, 4, 4, and 8, it is crucial to develop a rigorous and precise framework for evaluating moves. This ensures each step adheres strictly to the game's rules and logically progresses toward the target of 24. The following model synthesizes key insights from previous evaluations and recent learnings, emphasizing legality, accurate bookkeeping, and strategic value of operations.\n\n**1. Enforce Strict Legality of Operations**\n\nEvery move must be permissible within the rules:\n\n- **Utilization of Numbers:** Each initial number (1, 4, 4, 8) can be used only once per move. Reusing the same number without explicit creation or proper tracking is invalid. For example, combining 4 + 4 to produce 8 is valid, but doing so twice or reusing the same 4 in multiple steps without proper accounting is forbidden.\n- **Allowed Operations:** Only addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7) are permitted. Operations must be mathematically valid; division by zero is disallowed. Intermediate results may be fractional or negative if justified within the move sequence, provided they result from valid calculations.\n- **Number Creation and Usage:** Any new number introduced must originate from combining available numbers exactly once. For example, creating 16 by adding 8 + 8 is valid only if two 8s are present and each is used once in that operation.\n\n**Implication:** Before executing any move, verify that it uses only numbers currently available, each exactly once, and that the operation is valid. This prevents invalid moves based on incorrect assumptions about number usage.\n\n**2. Precise Tracking of Number Usage and Set Updates**\n\nPost-move, the set of numbers must be updated meticulously:\n\n- **Remove Used Numbers:** When combining two numbers, remove both original values from the current set.\n- **Add Resulting Number:** Insert the outcome of the operation into the set.\n- **Maintain Consistency:** Do not discard or reuse numbers arbitrarily. The set after each step must reflect exactly what remains, ensuring logical progress.\n\nFor example, performing 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 involves removing both 4s and adding 16. This prevents illegal reuse or overuse of initial numbers, preserving the integrity of the move sequence.\n\n**Implication:** Clear bookkeeping ensures move legitimacy, prevents errors, and maintains a logical progression toward the goal.\n\n**3. Value Progression and Strategic Simplification**\n\nEach move should be evaluated based on how effectively it advances toward 24:\n\n- **Aim for Progress:** Moves that produce intermediate results closer to 24 are generally promising. For example, obtaining 16 or 8 as intermediate steps can facilitate reaching 24 through addition or multiplication.\n"

Crucially, the set of remaining numbers after each operation must accurately reflect this process, and original numbers can only be used once unless reconstructed explicitly from previous results.\n\nKey insights for this specific puzzle:\n\n1. **Accurate Tracking of Remaining Numbers:**  \n   Every operation consumes two numbers from the current set, replacing them with their result. For example, starting with {1, 4, 4, 8}, an operation like 8 / 4 = 2 uses up 8 and 4, leaving {1, 4, 2}\u2014not {1, 2, 4, 8} as previously suggested. Ensuring this correct update is critical; incorrect bookkeeping leads to invalid steps.\n\n2. **Explicit Construction of Intermediate Results:**  \n   To generate helpful intermediate numbers like 3 or 6, construct them explicitly from available numbers. For instance, dividing 8 by 4 yields 2, and adding 1 gives 3. This 3 can then be multiplied by 8 or 4 as needed to reach 24. Such steps should follow the actual current set after each operation.\n\n3. **Using Division Strategically to Generate Small Useful Numbers:**  \n   Since dividing 8 by 4 yields 2, this is an essential step. Combining 2 with 1 yields 3, a useful multiplier. For example:  \n   - 8 / 4 = 2 (sets: {1, 4, 2})  \n   - 2 + 1 = 3 (sets: {3, 4})  \n   - 3 \u00d7 8 (if 8 is still available) or other combinations can then progress toward 24.\n\n4. **Prioritize Creating 3 or 6 Early:**  \n   Creating 3 (via 8 / 4 + 1) or 6 (from 2 \u00d7 3) simplifies factoring 24, as 24 = 6",

This updated model consolidates these insights into a concise guide tailored for this specific set of numbers.\n\n**1. Enforce Strict Legality of Operations**\n\n- **Use of Numbers:** At each step, only the current set of available numbers can be used. Each number must be used exactly once unless explicitly duplicated through prior operations. For instance, combining 4 + 4 to produce 8 is valid only if two 4s are present and each is used once. Creating multiple 8s without proper duplication violates the rules.\n\n- **Permissible Operations:** Only addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7) are allowed. Operations must be mathematically valid: division by zero is forbidden, and fractional or negative intermediate results are permitted only if derived legitimately. Before executing, verify the operation\u2019s validity and the availability of operands.\n\n- **Number Creation:** Any new number must directly result from combining current available numbers exactly once. For example, forming 16 by adding 8 + 8 is valid only if both 8s are present and each is used in that operation. Do not assume the existence of numbers not present or created legitimately.\n\n*Implication:* Always validate that the move uses only existing numbers, each once, and that the operation is mathematically valid. This prevents invalid or impossible moves.\n\n**2.

This prevents invalid reuse or creation of numbers from nowhere.\n\nKey insights:\n\n1. **Accurate bookkeeping of remaining numbers:**  \n   After each operation, update the set precisely. For example, starting with {1, 4, 4, 8}, performing 8 / 4 = 2 consumes an 8 and a 4, leaving {1, 4, 2}. Any subsequent steps must operate only on current set elements, avoiding assumptions of unchanged numbers.\n\n2. **Constructing useful intermediate numbers:**  \n   Generate small, flexible numbers like 2, 3, or 6 only through legitimate operations. For instance, dividing 8 by 4 yields 2, which can then be combined with remaining numbers to reach 24. Creating 3 by adding 1 and 2 (if available) can serve as a multiplier or divisor. These intermediates are crucial for simplifying the path to 24.\n\n3. **Prioritize early creation of small strategic numbers:**  \n   Focus on generating 2 early (e.g., 8 / 4 = 2). Then, combine this with other numbers to reach 24 more straightforwardly. For example, after obtaining 2, multiplying it by 12 (which can be formed via 4 * 3, with 3 derived from 1 + 2) can give 24.\n\n4. **Avoid invalid operations:**  \n   Any formula that attempts to use a number not present in the current set or reuses a number more times than available",
                    "value_summary": "Refined Evaluation Model for the 1, 4, 4, 8 Puzzle in the Game of 24\n\nWhen approaching the 1, 4, 4, 8 puzzle, it is essential to develop a disciplined and strategic framework that ensures legality, accurate bookkeeping, and effective reasoning. Drawing from recent learnings, this model emphasizes key principles to evaluate the promise of moves and avoid invalid steps.\n\n**1. Enforce Strict Legality of Operations**\n\n- **Number Usage:** Only utilize the current set of available numbers. Each number must be used exactly once unless explicitly duplicated through previous operations. For example, forming two 8s by adding 4 + 4 is valid only if both 4s are present and used once each. Do not assume or create numbers out of thin air; every number in an operation must originate from the current available set.\n\n- **Operation Validity:** Only addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7) are permitted. Before executing an operation, verify that it is mathematically valid\u2014no division by zero, and that fractional or negative results are acceptable only if they result directly from legitimate use of the current numbers.\n\n- **Number Formation:** Any new number must result directly from combining existing numbers exactly once. For instance, creating 3 from 4 \u2212 1 is valid if both 4 and 1 are available and used once. Do not assume the existence of numbers not derived legitimately from current numbers; this maintains integrity in bookkeeping and prevents invalid moves.\n\n*Implication:* Always validate that each move adheres to these rules. Moves that reuse numbers more times than available, involve invalid operations, or generate numbers without legitimate derivation undermine progress and lead to dead ends.\n\n**2. Precise Bookkeeping of Numbers**\n\n- **Removing Used Numbers:** After combining two numbers, remove both from the current set before proceeding. For example, combining 8 and 4 into 2 means removing 8 and 4 from the set and adding 2, ensuring the set accurately reflects remaining options.\n\n- **Tracking"

Recent insights from detailed step analyses and feedback highlight essential principles that improve move evaluation and prevent invalid steps.\n\n**1. Enforce Strict Legality of Operations**\n\n- **Number Usage:** Every operation must draw from the current set of available numbers precisely once per number involved. For example, creating an intermediate value like 2 from 8 and 4 (i.e., 8 \u00f7 4 = 2) is valid only if both 8 and 4 are present before the operation. It is invalid to reuse the same number more than once in different steps unless multiple copies are originally available. Do not assume the ability to generate or duplicate numbers without legitimate operations.\n\n- **Operation Validity:** Only addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7) are permitted. Before executing, verify the operation is mathematically valid\u2014no division by zero or undefined results. Negative or fractional results are acceptable if they directly follow from legitimate use of current numbers; however, intermediate steps should be tracked to ensure correctness.\n\n- **Number Formation:** Any new number must be directly derived from combining existing available numbers exactly once. For example, from 4 and 1, forming 3 via 4 \u2212 1 is valid if both are available. Creating a number out of thin air or assuming the existence of a number not derived from current set leads to invalid steps.\n\n*Implication:* Always validate each move against these rules. Moves that reuse numbers more than available, involve invalid operations, or generate numbers without proper derivation are invalid and lead to dead ends.\n\n**2. Precise Bookkeeping of Numbers**\n\n- **Remove Used Numbers:** After combining two numbers, remove both from the current set before proceeding. For instance, if combining 8 and 4 into 2, then remove 8 and 4 from the set, and add 2. This ensures the set accurately reflects remaining options and prevents accidental reuse.\n\n- **Track All Derivations:** Maintain"

Multiplying the two 6s yields 36, which can be manipulated to reach 24 by subtracting or dividing. For example, 6 \u00d7 6 = 36; then, subtract 12 (from 4 + 8, but since 8 isn't available, consider alternative methods). Alternatively, recognize that dividing one 6 by the other (6 \u00f7 6 = 1) provides a useful factor to incorporate the remaining numbers. \n\nA key approach is to create intermediate totals that approach 24 through addition or subtraction. For instance, combining 9 and 4 to get 13, then adding the 6 to reach 19, or manipulating sums to reach close to 24. However, a more direct route involves multiplying 4 and 6 to get 24 immediately: 4 \u00d7 6 = 24, which solves the puzzle instantly,",

This move uses two of the four numbers directly and provides an immediate solution, making it the most efficient strategy.\n\nIf that initial move isn't allowed or desired, focus on combining the remaining numbers to reach 24. Notably, the pair of 6s can be manipulated to facilitate this. Dividing one 6 by the other (6 \u00f7 6 = 1) creates a useful factor, which can then be multiplied by 4 and 9 to approach 24. For example, multiplying 4 by 6 gives 24 immediately; if that's not permitted, consider 6 \u00f7 6 = 1, then multiply this 1 by 9 to get 9, and combine with 4 via addition or subtraction to reach 24.\n\nGiven the previous attempt's insights, avoid reusing intermediate results improperly or trying to recombine numbers to reach 24 once it has been achieved.

The most straightforward solution is to recognize that multiplying 4 by 6 yields 24 immediately: **4 \u00d7 6 = 24**. This completes the puzzle instantly and should be the first step if permissible.\n\nIf that move isn\u2019t allowed or if exploring alternative solutions, focus on combining the two 6s to create useful intermediate results. Dividing one 6 by the other (6 \u00f7 6 = 1) produces a 1, which can then be multiplied by 9 to get 9 (1 \u00d7 9 = 9). This leaves 4 untouched, and combining 4 with the 9 requires an operation that results in 24. For example, adding 4 + 20 (which isn't directly possible) is invalid, so instead, explore pairing 9 with 6s or 4s to reach 24.\n\nA key insight is to avoid invalid steps that introduce numbers not present in the original set. For instance, attempting to divide 9 by 3 assumes the presence of 3, which isn\u2019t in the initial",
                    "value_summary": "For the 4, 6, 6, 9 puzzle, an effective evaluation model combines prior insights with recent feedback to prioritize promising moves. Moves that directly produce 24, such as multiplying 4\u00d76=24, remain highly promising, as they solve the puzzle immediately. Generating intermediate values like 12, 8, or 3 that can be combined into 24 are also valuable, provided they are derived through valid operations without reusing numbers. It\u2019s crucial to ensure that each move uses only the current set of available numbers, respecting the rules of the game\u2014no reusing or misapplying numbers. Recent feedback emphasizes the importance of move legality: for example, producing a 3 from 9 divided by 3 is valid only if both 9 and 3 are available at that point; using a 3 not originally present or already used invalidates the move.

The key is recognizing immediate solutions or creating intermediate results that lead to 24.\n\nFirst, the most straightforward move is multiplying 4 by 6: **4 \u00d7 6 = 24**, achieving the target instantly. This should be the first consideration if the rules permit simple multiplicative use of the numbers as they are.\n\nIf that move isn\u2019t permissible or if exploring alternative solutions, consider combining the two 6s to generate useful intermediate numbers. Dividing one 6 by the other yields **6 \u00f7 6 = 1**, which is valid and keeps the original numbers intact. Multiplying this 1 by 9 gives **1 \u00d7 9 = 9**, preserving the set of remaining numbers as 4, 6, and 6.\n\nNext, look for ways to incorporate 4 into forming 24. For instance, multiplying 4 by 6 yields 24 directly, but if that\u2019s already used, then consider adding or subtracting the remaining 6s to reach a multiple of 24. For example, combining the two 6s with operations to produce 12 (e.g",
                    "value_summary": "In solving the 4, 6, 6, 9 puzzle, effective evaluation hinges on move legality, immediate payoff, and strategic intermediate goals. Moves that directly produce 24, such as multiplying 4\u00d76, are highly promising, as they solve the puzzle outright. Generating intermediate values like 12, 8, or 3\u2014through valid operations\u2014can facilitate reaching 24 if combined appropriately, provided no rules are broken (e.g., reusing numbers or using unavailable values). Crucially, each move must use only the current set of available numbers, maintaining game integrity; for example, dividing 9 by 3 is valid only if 3 is present and unused at that step. Recent feedback underscores that invalid moves\u2014such"

Recognize immediate solutions like multiplying 4 by 6 to reach 24 directly (**4 \u00d7 6 = 24**). If that move isn't permissible or if alternatives are needed, consider combining the two 6s to generate helpful intermediate values. Dividing the 6s (**6 \u00f7 6 = 1**) produces a neutral element, which can be multiplied by 9 to get 9 (**1 \u00d7 9 = 9**), leaving the remaining 4 unused. \n\nNext, explore incorporating the 4: multiplying 4 by 6 (**4 \u00d7 6 = 24**) remains the most straightforward route. Avoid invalid moves such as attempting to use a number more than once, as seen in failed attempts where 9 was doubled artificially. Instead, look for solutions that combine the remaining numbers logically\u2014like summing or multiplying to",

Moves that directly produce 24\u2014such as 4\u00d76\u2014are highly promising. Intermediate values like 12, 8, 3, or 9 are strategic if they can lead to 24 through subsequent operations, but only if they are generated legitimately from the original numbers without violating rules. The recent feedback highlights the importance of verifying the presence of numbers before operations; for example, attempting to add 9 + 9 is invalid if 9 has not been created earlier.

The core strategy hinges on recognizing straightforward calculations and avoiding invalid reuse or dropping of numbers.\n\nFirst, consider the immediate and most straightforward operation: multiplying 4 by 6 (**4 \u00d7 6 = 24**). This directly yields the target number without complex manipulations, utilizing two of the given numbers efficiently. If this move is permissible, it provides an instant solution.\n\nWhen such direct solutions aren\u2019t straightforward or when exploring alternative paths, focus on combining the duplicate 6s. Dividing the two 6s (**6 \u00f7 6 = 1**) produces a neutral element, which can be multiplied by 9 to get 9 (**1 \u00d7 9 = 9**). In this scenario, the remaining number is 4, which can be multiplied or added as needed to reach 24 through subsequent operations, always ensuring no number is reused improperly.\n\nAvoid strategies that involve subtracting or adding numbers in a way that leaves invalid or re-used values. For example, subtracting 6 from 9 (**9 - 6 = 3**) is valid, but subsequent attempts to incorporate this 3 must respect the rule of using each original number exactly once. The previous attempt showed that reusing numbers or dropping them without proper tracking leads to illegal moves, resulting in an \"impossible\" label.\n\nKey refined tactic: **Prioritize operations that directly produce 24 or intermediate values that can be combined to reach 24 without reusing numbers or creating invalid states.** For instance, combining 4 with the product or sum of the remaining numbers, ensuring each",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves for the 4, 6, 6, 9 puzzle, focus on legality, strategic value, and progress toward 24. Valid moves strictly use available numbers without reusing or creating new ones unless explicitly allowed. Immediate solutions like 4\u00d76 or 9+15 are promising, but only if both numbers involved exist from prior steps. Intermediate results (e.g., 12, 8, 3) are valuable if they can lead to 24, provided they are generated legitimately from the original set. Critical is verifying the presence of each number before performing operations; attempting to combine nonexistent or reused values invalidates the move. Moves that produce intermediate values must be achievable through proper sequence, respecting the"

Here's a comprehensive, concise approach tailored to these particular numbers:\n\n**1. Prioritize Direct Multiplication When Possible**  \nThe most straightforward solution is to identify if two numbers multiply directly to 24. In this case, **6 \u00d7 4 = 24** is an immediate and valid solution using two of the given numbers. This move instantly solves the puzzle without complex manipulations, so always check for such opportunities first. Since 6 and 4 are present, **multiplying them yields 24 directly**, making this the most efficient strategy.\n\n**2. Use the Duplicate 6s to Create Neutral Elements**  \nGiven the two 6s, dividing one by the other produces a neutral element: **6 \u00f7 6 = 1**. This is a valid operation that leaves the remaining numbers unchanged and introduces a \"1\" that can be used in subsequent calculations. However, recent feedback indicates that subsequent steps involving this \"1\" must be carefully scrutinized to ensure no invalid reuse or dropping occurs.\n\n**3. Be Cautious with Step-by-Step Operations**  \nWhile dividing the 6s to get 1 is valid, the subsequent attempt to combine this 1 with the remaining numbers (4 and 9) must maintain the integrity of the rules\u2014each original number can only be used once, and no new numbers can be introduced or dropped arbitrarily. For example, after obtaining 1, trying to multiply or add it to other numbers to reach 24 must be done through valid operations without reusing or dropping numbers improperly.\n\n**4. Recognize When a Direct Solution Is Feasible**  \nThe critical insight is to recognize that **multiplying 6 by 4** directly yields 24, which is a complete solution. This avoids unnecessary complexity and potential invalid steps. Therefore, whenever the numbers 6 and 4 are available, prioritize this operation.\n\n**5. Explore Alternative Combinations When Direct Solutions Are Not Obvious**  \nIf the direct multiplication isn't viable (for example, if 4 or 6 is unavailable), consider combining the remaining numbers through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division to reach 24. For instance, if the scenario involves using the remaining 6 and 9, check whether their combination can produce 24:\n\n- 6 \u00d7 4",

This involves recognizing valid operations, respecting the uniqueness of each number, and prioritizing straightforward solutions to minimize complexity.\n\n**1. Prioritize Direct Multiplication for Immediate Solutions**  \nThe most efficient move is to identify if any two numbers multiply directly to 24. Here, **6 \u00d7 4 = 24** provides an immediate and valid solution, using two of the original numbers without additional steps. Always check for such direct solutions first, as they eliminate the need for complex manipulations and reduce the chances of rule violations.\n\n**2. Use the Duplicate 6s to Create Neutral Elements Carefully**  \nThe two 6s offer an important strategic tool: dividing one by the other produces **6 \u00f7 6 = 1**. This operation is valid and introduces a \"1\" into the calculation, which can serve as a neutral multiplier or additive to facilitate reaching 24. However, recent feedback highlights that subsequent steps involving this \"1\" must be carefully executed to avoid reusing or dropping numbers improperly. After obtaining 1, combine it with remaining numbers via valid operations, ensuring each original number is used exactly once.\n\n**3. Strictly Maintain the Integrity of Number Usage**  \nAny step must respect the rule that each original number is used only once, and no new numbers are introduced arbitrarily. For example, forming \"54\" by multiplying 6 and 9 is legitimate if done explicitly as a step (6 \u00d7 9 = 54), and subsequent steps involve only these existing numbers. However, combining \"54\" with 9 to produce \"54 / 9\" (which equals 6) is valid only if \"54\" was explicitly formed in a previous step, and all intermediate steps are clearly documented. The key is to avoid conceptual shortcuts or implicit number formations that violate the step-by-step process.\n\n**4. Recognize When a Direct Solution Is Feasible**  \nGiven the numbers, the simplest and most effective approach is to look for direct multiplications. Since **6 \u00d7 4 = 24** is possible, it should be attempted first, as it immediately solves the puzzle without involving the remaining numbers (another 6 and 9). This approach minimizes complexity and reduces potential rule violations.\n\n**5.

For example, combining two 6s to produce 36 is valid, but only if both 6s are still available.  \n- **No creation of new numbers:** Intermediate results like 4 or 9 must originate directly from the current set through valid operations. For instance, producing 4 by subtracting 2 from 6 is valid only if 2 is available or can be formed legitimately.  \n- **Proper consumption of numbers:** When combining numbers, those numbers are considered \"used\" and unavailable for subsequent operations unless explicitly restored by a previous step. The total count of each number must be respected throughout.\n\n**2. Strategic Progression Toward 24:**  \n- **Prioritize straightforward operations:** Multiplication and addition that directly lead to or approach 24 are more promising. For example, 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 is immediately successful if both numbers are available.  \n- **Avoid unnecessary complexity:** Moves that produce intermediate values unlikely to contribute to 24 (like 1 or 3) should be considered only if they open pathways to 24"

The core goal is to find a sequence of operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014that combines these four numbers into exactly 24, with each original number used exactly once.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Direct Multiplication for Immediate Solutions**  \nStart by checking whether any two numbers multiply directly to 24. In this set, **6 \u00d7 4 = 24** is an immediate and valid solution because both 6 and 4 are present in the original set. Recognizing such straightforward solutions early minimizes complexity and reduces the risk of rule violations. If this is achievable, it is the most efficient path to success.\n\n2. **Utilize the Duplicate 6s to Create Neutral Elements Carefully**  \nThe two 6s offer a strategic advantage: dividing one 6 by the other yields **6 \u00f7 6 = 1**, which can serve as a neutral multiplier or additive element. This approach should be employed only after confirming the operation's validity and ensuring that the resulting '1' is used appropriately in subsequent steps. For example, once you have '1', you might multiply it by another number or add it to facilitate reaching 24, but only if such steps align with the rule of using each original number once and do not involve reusing or dropping numbers improperly.\n\n3. **Avoid Unjustified Number Formations and Operations**  \nA common pitfall is forming numbers like 36 from the original set without explicitly showing the operations to do so. For instance, claiming **36 / 9 = 4** is only valid if 36 was explicitly formed from **6 \u00d7 6** in a prior step, and all intermediate steps are clearly documented. Any step that introduces a number not directly derived from the original numbers or prior valid calculations violates the rules. To stay compliant, always break down each intermediate number into operations involving the original numbers.\n\n4. **Focus on Valid Operations and Use Each Number Once**  \nEvery move must be a legitimate operation involving only the current set of numbers, with no repeats or omissions. For example, if you decide to multiply 6 and 4 to get",
                    "value_summary": "**Refined Evaluation Model for the 4, 6, 6, 9 Puzzle**\n\nIn the Game of 24 with the numbers 4, 6, 6, and 9, effective move evaluation hinges on legality, strategic value, and the potential to reach 24 efficiently. Recent insights highlight the importance of strictly adhering to the current set of numbers at each step and avoiding invalid operations.\n\n**1. Legality of Operations:**  \n- **Use only current numbers:** Every operation must combine numbers available at that specific step. Reusing or reusing numbers beyond their initial count (e.g., two 6s) is permissible only if both are present in the current subset.  \n- **No creation of new numbers:** Intermediate results should be derived solely from the current numbers without assuming the existence of new or previously unavailable values. For example, producing 4 by subtracting 2 from 6 is valid only if 2 is available or can be formed legitimately.  \n- **Proper consumption:** Once numbers are combined, the original numbers are considered consumed unless explicitly restored or reintroduced through valid operations.

Recent feedback underscores the importance of only using the original numbers and their legitimate combinations at each step.\n\n**Prioritize Immediate Multiplication of 6 and 4:**  \nThe simplest and most direct solution is recognizing that 6 \u00d7 4 = 24. Since both 6 and 4 are present in the initial set, this operation immediately yields the target number 24 without further complication, satisfying all rules. This approach is optimal, as it minimizes the number of steps and reduces the chance of invalid operations.\n\n**Use the Two 6s to Create a Neutral Element:**  \nIf the direct multiplication isn\u2019t apparent or viable, consider utilizing the duplicate 6s to generate an intermediate value that can facilitate reaching 24. Dividing one 6 by the other yields 6 \u00f7 6 = 1, a neutral element. This '1' can be multiplied by 9 to get 9, or combined with other operations to manipulate the total towards 24, provided each step strictly involves original numbers or their valid combinations.\n\n**Avoid Formulating Numbers Without Clear Operations:**  \nA common mistake is to assume or state numbers like 36 or 12 without explicitly showing how they are formed from the original set. For example, claiming 36 / 9 = 4 is only valid if 36 was explicitly derived from 6 \u00d7 6. To stay within rules, always demonstrate how each intermediate number is obtained through valid operations involving the original numbers. For example, 6 \u00d7 6 = 36 is valid, but dividing 36 by 9 to get 4 must be justified by first establishing 36 from",

Moves must strictly use only the current set of available numbers; no intermediate or derived numbers (like 3) are valid unless explicitly produced within the current step. Reusing or reintroducing numbers beyond their initial count is invalid unless operations explicitly generate those values from existing numbers. For example, creating 12 via 6\u00d72 is only valid if 2 was legitimately derived during the current move, not assumed.\n\nStrategically, direct pathways such as 6\u00d74=24 are optimal, instantly solving the puzzle.

Key insights from previous attempts highlight the importance of validating each operation and using only the current set of numbers at each step.\n\n**Prioritize Direct Multiplication of 6 and 4:**  \nThe simplest and most effective move is recognizing that 6 \u00d7 4 = 24. Since both 6 and 4 are in the initial set, performing this multiplication immediately yields 24, satisfying the goal in one step. This approach is optimal, as it minimizes complexity and avoids unnecessary intermediate steps.\n\n**Use the Two 6s to Generate a Neutral Element:**  \nIf the immediate multiplication isn\u2019t apparent, consider using the duplicate 6s to create an intermediate value that can facilitate reaching 24. Dividing one 6 by the other yields 6 \u00f7 6 = 1, a neutral element. This '1' can then be multiplied by 9 to get 9 or combined with other operations to manipulate the total toward 24, provided each operation strictly involves the original numbers or their valid combinations.\n\n**Caution with Intermediate Numbers and Operations:**  \nWhen combining numbers, always verify that each result is explicitly derived from previous steps using valid operations. For example, forming 36 by multiplying 6 \u00d7 6 is valid; dividing 36 by 9 to get 4 is valid only if 36 was explicitly formed from the original 6s. Avoid assumptions like \"36 / 9 = 4\" without demonstrating the intermediate step of obtaining 36 from the initial set.\n\n**Handling Previous Failures:**  \nIn past attempts, missteps involved reusing results improperly or dropping numbers from the current set, violating the rules. For example, dividing 6 by 6 to get 1 is valid, but subsequent steps must only use the remaining numbers and the new result, ensuring no numbers are reused or omitted without justification.\n\n**Step-by-Step Validation:**  \n- **Step 1:** Use 6 and 6: 6 \u00f7 6 = 1 (remaining numbers: 4, 9, 1).  \n  Label: Sure \u2014 valid operation, numbers are from the initial set, and the set now",

Each move must exclusively utilize the current set of available numbers, with no intermediate or derived values introduced unless explicitly produced within that move. Reusing or reintroducing numbers beyond their initial count\u2014such as creating 3 from 6/2 when 2 was not previously generated\u2014is invalid. \n\nStrategically, direct solutions like 6\u00d74=24 are optimal, instantly concluding the puzzle. When combining numbers, choices should aim to rapidly approach or reach 24, prioritizing straightforward operations (multiplication or addition) over convoluted methods that risk invalid moves or resource mismanagement. For example, dividing 6/6=1 is valid and reduces the set, but subsequent steps must only use the remaining numbers (4, 1, 9), and any attempt to use numbers not present or to generate new numbers outside the current set violates rules.\n\nRecent analysis indicates that progressing from the initial set (4, 6, 6, "

Based on past attempts and recent learnings, focus on strategies that minimize steps and avoid invalid intermediate results.\n\n**Key Insights from Past Attempts:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Immediate Multiplication of 6 and 4:**  \nThe simplest path is recognizing that 6 \u00d7 4 = 24. Using this move immediately achieves the target in one step, making it the most efficient solution. This straightforward approach avoids unnecessary complexity and aligns with optimal problem-solving practices.\n\n2. **Utilize the Two 6s to Create Neutral Elements:**  \nIf the immediate multiplication isn\u2019t apparent, consider using the duplicate 6s to generate an intermediate value that can facilitate reaching 24. Dividing one 6 by the other yields 6 \u00f7 6 = 1, which acts as a neutral element. Multiplying this 1 by 9 gives 9, or using it in other operations, can help manipulate the total toward 24. For instance, combining 1 with 4 through multiplication (1 \u00d7 4 = 4) or addition (1 + 4 = 5) can set up for future steps, provided each operation uses only the current set of numbers.\n\n3. **Avoid Reusing Results Improperly:**  \nPast failures involved reusing intermediate results as new numbers without proper validation or dropping numbers from the set without justification. For example, forming 36 by multiplying 6 \u00d7 6 is valid, but dividing 36 by 9 to get 4 requires explicitly forming 36 from the original 6s. Each step must be validated by working within the current set, ensuring no numbers are reused or omitted incorrectly.\n\n4. **Validate Each Operation and Result:**  \nAlways verify that each operation is valid and that the resulting number can be legitimately derived from the initial set or previous valid steps. For example, if you form 36 by multiplying 6 \u00d7 6, then dividing 36 by 9 to get ",
                    "value_summary": "**Refined Evaluation Model for the 4, 6, 6, 9 Puzzle**\n\nEffective progress toward solving the 24 puzzle with numbers 4, 6, 6, and 9 relies on strict adherence to move legality, resource management, and strategic reduction. Moves are valid only if they follow these principles:\n\n1. **Use of Available Numbers Only:** Each operation must combine numbers currently in the set. No introducing new numbers or creating values outside the existing set unless explicitly derived within the move.\n\n2. **Accurate Resource Tracking:** After each operation, the used numbers are removed, and the result replaces them. Remaining numbers are those not involved in the move. For example, performing 4 \u00d7 6 (using one 4 and one 6) leaves the other 6 and the 9 untouched, resulting in a new set: {24, 6, 9}.\n\n3. **Operation Legality and Validity:** Only permitted operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\u2014are allowed. Dividing 6 by 6 to obtain 1 is valid and reduces the set, but subsequent steps must only employ remaining numbers, respecting the current set.\n\n4. **Prioritize Direct or Simplest Solutions:** Moves that quickly approach or reach 24\u2014such as 6\u00d74=24\u2014are optimal. Avoid convoluted sequences that risk invalid moves or resource mismanagement.\n\n5. **Consistent Updating of Remaining Numbers:** After each move, explicitly adjust the set to reflect used and remaining numbers. For example, after 4\u00d76=24, remaining numbers are {6, 9}.\n\nApplying these principles to 4, 6, 6, 9:\n\n- An effective first step is 6\u00d74=24, which immediately solves the puzzle, leaving {6, 9}. This is ideal and terminates the sequence successfully.\n\n- Alternatively, dividing 6 by 6 to get 1 and then"

The most efficient solution is immediately evident: multiplying one 6 by 4 (6 \u00d7 4 = 24), which accomplishes the goal in a single step. This approach is optimal, minimizes complexity, and should be prioritized.\n\nIf this direct path isn't apparent, consider alternative methods involving the two 6s.

The recent analysis underscores the importance of strict adherence to move legality, precise resource tracking, and logical sequencing. Here is an updated, concise model synthesizing prior principles and recent insights:\n\n**1. Use of Available Numbers Only:**  \nEvery operation must combine numbers currently present in the set. No external numbers or values outside the current set are permitted unless explicitly derived within the move. For example, to perform 6\u00d74=24, both 6 and 4 must be present in the current set.\n\n**2. Accurate Resource Tracking:**  \nAfter each move, the used numbers are removed from the set, and the result replaces them. Remaining numbers are those not involved in the move. For instance, executing 6\u00d74=24 removes 6 and 4, leaving the set with {6, 9}. This precise updating ensures clarity about what moves are possible next.\n\n**3. Operation Legality and Validity:**  \nOnly addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are permitted, and they must be applied correctly. For example, dividing 6 by 6 to obtain 1 is valid and reduces the set, provided both 6s are available. Moves resulting in invalid results or involving unavailable numbers are prohibited.\n\n**4. Prioritize Direct or Simplest Solutions:**  \nMoves that directly produce 24, such as 6\u00d74=24, are optimal. They solve the puzzle immediately or significantly reduce complexity. Avoid convoluted sequences that risk invalid moves or mismanage resources, which can lead to dead ends.\n\n**5. Proper Sequencing and State Awareness:**  \nEach step\u2019s leftover numbers must accurately reflect the previous move's result. Recent attempts reveal that mislabeling or misrepresent"

The optimal move is to recognize that multiplying 6 by 4 yields 24 immediately: **6 \u00d7 4 = 24**. This accomplishes the goal in a single step, making it the most direct and effective solution.\n\nIf this immediate route isn't apparent, focus on utilizing the two 6s to generate useful intermediate values. Dividing the two 6s produces a neutral element: **6 \u00f7 6 = 1**. This '1' can serve as a versatile tool for manipulating remaining numbers without altering their value. For example, multiplying this 1 by 9 gives 9, which can be combined with the remaining 4 to reach 24\u2014though this path is less direct and requires additional steps.\n\nIn previous attempts, a common pitfall involved invalid operations, such as reusing numbers multiple times or dropping values without proper justification.

Past attempts highlight that leveraging multiplication early, especially involving the larger or more versatile numbers, tends to be most effective.\n\n**Key Insights and Approach:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Multiplication for Immediate Results:**  \n   The most straightforward move is to look for pairs that multiply directly to 24. Since 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, this is an immediate and optimal solution, leaving the remaining numbers 6 and 9. Recognizing such pairs upfront saves time and reduces complexity.\n\n2. **Utilize the Repetition of 6s for Flexibility:**  \n   The two 6s can be used to generate intermediate values such as 36 (6 \u00d7 6) or 1 (6 \u00f7 6). These intermediates can then be combined with the remaining numbers to reach 24. For example, dividing the two 6s yields 1, which can serve as a neutral multiplier or divisor.\n\n3. **Avoid Invalid or Reused Operations:**  \n   Past mistakes involved reusing numbers in ways that violate game rules (e.g., subtracting or dividing values that are no longer available). It's crucial to keep track of which numbers are used and ensure each operation involves only the current set of available numbers.\n\n4. **Focus on Single-Step or Two-Step Solutions When Possible:**  \n   The goal is to reach 24 efficiently. Using a single multiplication (6 \u00d7 4) achieves this immediately. When this isn't feasible, look for operations that generate 24 in two steps, such as combining the remaining numbers after initial manipulations.\n\n5. **Consider the Remaining Numbers Carefully:**  \n   After using 6 and 4 to make 24, the leftovers are 6 and 9. Since 6 + 9 = 15, or 6 \u00d7 9 = 54, neither yields 24 directly. Attempts to split or combine these remaining numbers often fail unless they can produce intermediate values like 8, 12, or 24.\n\n6. **Use the 'Neutral' 1 When Needed:**  \n   Dividing the two 6s gives 1, which can be multiplied with 9 to produce 9, or combined with other operations to reach 24. For example, (6 \u00f7 6) \u00d7 24 = 24, but this involves reusing the 6s as an intermediate, which is valid only if the division is performed on the two 6s before using them elsewhere.\n\n**Practical Strategy Summary:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Look for a direct multiplication involving a 4 and a 6 to reach 24.  \n  - **Example:** 6 \u00d7 4 = ",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 4, 6, 6, 9 Puzzle:\n\nEffective solution hinges on strategic move selection grounded in legality, resource management, and direct pathways. All operations must exclusively use the current numbers; no external or previously used numbers are permitted. After each move, the used numbers are removed from the set, and the resulting number replaces them, necessitating meticulous tracking of available resources. Moves must employ only addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, with valid results\u2014dividing identical numbers (e.g., 6 \u00f7 6 = 1) is legal if both are present; invalid or non-integer results are discouraged. Prioritize moves leading directly to 24, such as 6\u00d74, to simplify the pathway and reduce complexity. Recent"

Past attempts reveal that early multiplication involving larger or versatile numbers is often the most direct route, but careful planning is essential to avoid invalid steps.\n\n**Core Insights:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Early Multiplication with 4 and 6:**  \n   Since 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, this is an optimal, immediate solution. Executing this move uses both numbers 6 and 4, leaving the remaining numbers as 6 and 9. Recognizing this pairing upfront simplifies the problem drastically, making it the most straightforward approach.\n\n2. **Avoid Reusing or Recombining Numbers Prematurely:**  \n   Each number can only be used once unless combined into a new number through valid operations. For example, dividing 6 by 6 yields 1, which can be used as a neutral multiplier or divisor, but only once. Reusing a number or reusing the same value in multiple steps without proper operations violates game rules.\n\n3. **Leverage the Repetition of 6s for Flexibility:**  \n   The two 6s can be combined to produce useful intermediates\u2014either 36 (6\u00d76) or 1 (6\u00f76). Creating 36 may help in other manipulations, while 6\u00f76 = 1 can serve as a neutral factor when multiplied elsewhere.\n\n4. **Focus on Two- or Three-Step Solutions When Possible:**  \n   The goal is to reach 24 efficiently. If direct multiplication like 6\u00d74 works, that\u2019s ideal. Otherwise, consider operations that produce intermediate values such as 12, 8, or 24 in one or two steps, then combine with remaining numbers.\n\n5. **Carefully Track Remaining Numbers After Operations:**  \n   For example, if you perform 6\u00d74=24, the remaining numbers are 6 and 9. Since neither 6+9=15 nor 6\u00d79=54 equals 24, explore other combinations involving these leftovers. For example, dividing 6 by 6 yields 1, which",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 4, 6, 6, 9 Puzzle:\n\nEffective moves prioritize direct pathways to 24 using available numbers, emphasizing legality and resource management. Operations must involve only the current set of numbers, with no external or previously used values. After each move, the used numbers are removed, and their result replaces them, requiring careful tracking. Valid operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with results that are integers and within the available set. Dividing identical numbers (e.g., 6 \u00f7 6 = 1) is permissible if both are present, but invalid or non-integer results should be avoided. The primary goal is to create intermediate results that facilitate reaching 24 quickly, such as multiplying 6\u00d74, which directly yields 24. Recent attempts show that making a move involving 6 and 4 to get 24 is"

The key insights are:\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining Larger Numbers First:**  \n   Focus on using 13 and 8 to create intermediate totals close to 24. Since 13 and 8 are large, consider operations like multiplication or subtraction to reduce the complexity.\n\n2. **Avoid Invalid or Redundant Steps:**  \n   Do not perform operations like dividing a number by itself unless it yields 1, and ensure that each operation uses only the original numbers or previously obtained valid results. For example, performing 13/13 to get 1 is valid, but subsequent steps must correctly reflect the remaining numbers and their counts.\n\n3. **Use 1 and 2 for Fine-Tuning:**  \n   After combining larger numbers, use 1 and 2 with addition or multiplication to reach 24. For instance, if you have 16, adding 8 or multiplying small numbers to reach 24 is effective.\n\n4. **Construct Valid Intermediate Results:**  \n   When combining numbers, keep track of remaining values. For example, if you do 13 - 8 = 5, then use 5 with 2 and 1 to reach 24 by considering 5 * (some combination). Alternatively, if you get 16 (via 8 * 2), then adding 8 yields 24, but ensure that the operations adhere to the rules (no reusing numbers more than once unless combined properly).\n\n5. **Avoid Invalid Operations or Assumptions:**  \n  ",

Here's an optimized, step-by-step approach focusing on the unique characteristics of these numbers:\n\n**1. Leverage Large Numbers (8 and 13) First with Valid Operations**  \nStart by considering how to combine 8 and 13 because their direct operations can produce intermediate totals close to or useful for reaching 24. For example, summing them yields 21, which is close to 24, or multiplying them results in a larger number (104), which can be manipulated downwards. Importantly, the move 8 + 13 = 21 is legal and reduces the problem size effectively. This operation creates an intermediate value (21) and leaves the remaining numbers 1 and 2 untouched, providing flexibility for subsequent steps.\n\n**2. Use Subtraction or Multiplication to Fine-Tune Totals**  \nAfter obtaining 21, consider subtracting 1 or 2 to get closer to 20 or 19, or multiplying small numbers to reach 24 directly. For example, from 21, adding 2 results in 23; then, adding 1 yields 24. Alternatively, multiply 2 by 8 to get 16, then add 8 (if available) or 13 to approach 24. Remember, each operation must use only the current set of numbers\u2014once a number is combined, it's replaced by its result, and the original numbers are no longer available separately.\n\n**3. Focus on Valid Operations and Logical Sequencing**  \nEnsure that every move combines two numbers from the current set and replaces them with their result, adhering strictly to the rules. For example, combining 8 and 13 to get 21 is valid; then, using 2 to multiply with 8 or 13 to reach intermediate totals like 16 or 104. Use subtraction to reduce larger products or sums where appropriate, such as 13 - 8 = 5, which can then be combined with 2 or 1 to reach 24.\n\n**4. Use 1 and 2 for Fine Adjustment**  \nThe numbers 1 and 2",
                    "value_summary": "In the 24 game with numbers 1, 2, 8, 13, promising moves generate intermediate results that keep options open and avoid trivial or dead-end values. Moves leading to totals like 1, 2, or 5 tend to limit progress, as these often signal dead-ends or repeated states. Effective steps create diverse, manageable intermediate results, maintaining flexibility for future operations"

Here are the refined, actionable insights:\n\n1. **Prioritize combining large numbers (8 and 13) first using valid operations**. Since 8 and 13 are high and close in value, starting with their sum or difference can produce manageable intermediate results. For example, 8 + 13 = 21 is valid and yields a number close to 24, reducing the subsequent steps needed. Similarly, 13 - 8 = 5 offers a smaller number that can be easily manipulated later.\n\n2. **Avoid using invalid operations or introducing numbers outside the initial set**. The previous attempt used \"8 * 3 = 24,\" which is invalid because '3' wasn't among the starting numbers and cannot be created arbitrarily. All moves must strictly involve the original numbers or their results, obtained through permitted operations.\n\n3. **Use subtraction and division to create intermediate values that are factors or close to 24**. For example, subtracting 8 from 13 yields 5, which can then be multiplied or added with 1 or 2 to reach 24. For instance, 2 * 8 = 16, then adding 8 (from prior steps) or combining with other numbers could help, but only if operations are valid.\n\n4. **Leverage the small numbers (1 and 2) for fine adjustments**. Since 1 and 2 can be used to increment or decrement totals, they are essential for precise adjustments near 24. Multiplying 2 by 8 yields 16, which is close",
                    "value_summary": "In the 24 game with 1, 2, 8, 13, promising moves produce intermediate results that preserve flexibility and avoid trivial or dead-end totals such as 1, 2, or 5. Effective steps combine numbers to generate diverse, manageable intermediate values, maintaining multiple pathways toward 24. Moves that create impossible or invalid states\u2014such as attempting to use non-existent numbers or reusing numbers improperly\u2014are unpromising. Overall,"

Building upon prior insights and recent analyses, the refined approach emphasizes strategic pairings, valid operations, and incremental adjustments to reach the target of 24 efficiently.\n\n**1. Focus on Key Pairings Involving Large Numbers First**\n\nGiven that 8 and 13 are the largest numbers, initial attempts should prioritize combining them via addition or subtraction to produce intermediate results near 24. For example:\n\n- **Use addition:** 8 + 13 = 21, which is close to 24 and can be easily adjusted with small numbers.\n- **Use subtraction:** 13 - 8 = 5, a small number that facilitates subsequent operations.\n\nThese combinations simplify the path toward 24 because they generate manageable intermediate values and reduce complexity in later steps.\n\n**2. Avoid Invalid Operations and Strictly Use Original Numbers**\n\nAll operations must involve only the initial numbers or their results obtained through permitted operations. For instance, attempting to multiply by a number not derivable from the original set (like using 3 without it being created through prior steps) is invalid. This means:\n\n- Do not assume operations involving numbers outside the set unless they've been explicitly derived.\n- Be cautious with multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction to ensure all operands are valid.\n\n**3. Use Subtraction and Division to Create Useful Intermediates**\n\nSubtraction can produce small, convenient numbers such as 5 (from 13 - 8), which can then be manipulated to reach 24. Similarly, division can generate fractions or whole numbers that bring you closer to the target:\n\n- For example, dividing 8 by 2 yields 4, which is useful for fine-tuning totals.\n- Dividing 12 by 2 yields 6, and combining this with other numbers can help reach 24.\n\n**4. Exploit Small Numbers (1 and 2) for Precise Adjustments**\n\nNumbers 1 and 2 are essential for small incremental changes:\n\n- Multiplying 2 by 8 yields 16, a significant step toward 24.\n- Adding or subtracting 1 or 2 allows fine-tuning of totals",

Recent insights highlight the importance of strategic pairings involving the larger numbers (8 and 13), cautious operation sequencing, and judicious use of small numbers for fine-tuning.\n\n**Key Strategies:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining Large Numbers First to Generate Manageable Intermediates**  \nStarting with the largest numbers\u20148 and 13\u2014can produce valuable intermediates. For example:\n- Adding: 8 + 13 = 21, which is close to 24 and provides a solid base for incremental adjustments.\n- Subtracting: 13 - 8 = 5, which is a small, versatile number that can facilitate further operations toward 24.\nBy creating such intermediates early, you simplify the path to 24 and avoid unnecessary complexity later.\n\n2. **Use Valid Operations Only on Original or Derived Numbers**  \nAll calculations must involve only the initial numbers or results obtained through permitted operations. It is invalid to reuse numbers in a way that contradicts the rules:\n- Do not reuse the same number more than once unless it has been explicitly derived from previous operations.\n- Avoid attempting to multiply or divide by numbers not present in the current set of results.\nThis constraint emphasizes planning operations so that each step produces a usable intermediate without invalid reuse.\n\n3. **Leverage Subtraction and Division to Create Useful Small Numbers**  \nSubtraction often yields small, strategic numbers such as 5 (from 13 - 8). These small numbers are crucial for fine adjustments:\n- For example, once you have 5, you can multiply or add to reach 24.\nDivision can generate fractions or smaller integers that help bridge the gap:\n- Dividing 8 by 2 yields 4, which can be combined with other results to reach 24.\n- Dividing 12 (if created) by 2 yields 6, which is directly useful because 6 \u00d7 4 = 24.\nThis approach allows you to",

                    "summary": "To effectively solve the 24 puzzle with the specific numbers 1, 2, 8, and 13, it is essential to integrate the core strategic insights from previous attempts, focusing on actionable steps tailored to these numbers. The key is to leverage the properties of the larger numbers (8 and 13), utilize the smaller numbers (1 and 2) for fine adjustments, and follow strict operational rules to avoid invalid moves. Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step strategic guide rooted in these principles.\n\n**1. Prioritize Combining Large Numbers to Generate Manageable Intermediates**\n\nThe larger numbers, 8 and 13, are instrumental in creating intermediates close to or directly leading to 24. For example:\n\n- **Multiply 13 and 2:**  \n  13 \u00d7 2 = 26.  \n  Although 26 exceeds 24, it provides a valuable intermediate to work with.  \n- **Combine 8 and 3:**  \n  Since 3 isn't directly available, but can be obtained by subtracting 1 from 4 (which can be obtained by dividing 8 by 2), this approach is more complex but offers pathways.\n\n- **Add 8 and 13:**  \n  8 + 13 = 21, which is close to 24 and can be adjusted with small numbers.\n\n- **Subtract 8 from 13:**  \n  13 - 8 = 5, a small, flexible number that can be used for fine-tuning.\n\nThe goal of these initial combinations is to produce an intermediate that simplifies reaching 24, such as 21, 5, or 26, which can then be adjusted with the remaining small numbers.\n\n**2. Use Valid Operations Only on Remaining or Derived Numbers**\n\nEach move must strictly involve:\n\n- The current set of remaining numbers, or  \n- Results obtained from previous valid operations.\n\nReusing numbers without re-derivation is prohibited, and each operation counts as a single move. For example:\n\n- If you combine 13 and 2 to get 26, you cannot later split 26 into 13 and 13 unless you explicitly perform separate steps.  \n- You cannot reuse a number multiple times unless you have explicitly derived multiple instances from the original set.\n\nThis rule emphasizes careful planning\u2014anticipate the sequence of operations to avoid invalid reuse or dropping numbers incorrectly.\n\n**3. Leverage Subtraction and Division to Create Small, Handy Numbers**\n\nSubtraction and division are powerful tools for generating small or fractional numbers that facilitate reaching 24:\n\n- **Subtraction Examples:**  \n  - 13 - 8 = 5  \n  - 8 - 2 = 6  \n  - 2 - 1 = 1\n\n- **Division Examples:**  \n  - 8 \u00f7 2 = 4  \n  - 13 \u00f7 13 = 1 (if applicable)  \n  - 8 \u00f7 4 = 2\n\nSmall numbers like 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 are especially useful because:\n\n- They can be combined with each other or with other intermediates to reach 24 via multiplication or addition.  \n- For example, 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, or 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 if you can",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 1, 2, 8, 13 puzzle, the core principle is that promising steps preserve multiple pathways toward reaching 24. Effective moves combine larger and smaller numbers through valid operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014without reusing or invalidating original values. Moves that produce intermediate totals that are too trivial, such as 1, 2, or 5, or that significantly restrict future options, are less promising. Additionally, steps that result in intermediate values that cannot logically lead to 24, or that use numbers not present in the current set, are unpromising. Illegal moves\u2014such as creating numbers not derivable from the original set or reusing numbers improperly\u2014should be avoided, as they compromise the solution path and violate rules. Maintaining flexibility is crucial; promising moves keep multiple avenues open, avoiding early dead-ends. For this specific set, effective strategies prioritize combining intermediate results to approach 24 without narrowing options prematurely. Conversely, moves that rely on invalid operations or produce unresolvable intermediate values signal poor choices. Overall, the evaluation centers"

Here is a refined, concise strategy tailored to this particular set:\n\n**1. Leverage Large Numbers (8 and 13) to Generate Key Intermediates**\n\n- **Prioritize combining 8 and 13 to produce intermediates close to 24.**  \n  For example, subtract 8 from 13:  \n  13 - 8 = 5.  \n  This yields a small, flexible number (5) that can be combined with remaining small numbers to reach 24.\n\n- **Use multiplication involving 8 or 13 to produce larger intermediates.**  \n  For instance, 8 \u00d7 2 = 16, which is close to 24 and can be used with the remaining numbers.\n\n**2. Use Small Numbers (1 and 2) for Fine-Tuning**\n\n- **Generate small or fractional numbers via subtraction or division.**  \n  For example:  \n  - 2 - 1 = 1  \n  - 8 \u00f7 2 = 4  \n  - 13 \u00f7 13 = 1\n\n- **Combine small numbers with intermediates to reach 24.**  \n  For example,  \n  - 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 (if you can generate a 6 and a 4)  \n  - 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (if you can create 3)  \n\n**3. Focus on Valid Moves and Avoid Reusing or Dropping Numbers Improperly**\n\n- Each move must involve only the current set of numbers or their valid results.  \n- Do not reuse numbers unless they are explicitly re-derived; avoid drop or discard errors.  \n- Plan sequences carefully to ensure all intermediate numbers are valid and available for subsequent operations.\n\n**4. Use Subtraction and Division to Create Small, Manageable Numbers**\n\n- Generate small integers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 through subtraction or division to facilitate reaching 24 through multiplication or addition.  \n- For example:  \n  - 13 - 8 = 5  \n  - 8 \u00f7 2 = 4  \n  - 2 - 1 = 1\n\n- These small numbers are more versatile. For instance, once you have 4 and 6,",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 1, 2, 8, 13 puzzle, the core principle remains that promising steps preserve multiple pathways to reach 24. Effective moves involve combining larger and smaller numbers through valid operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014without invalid reuse or creation of numbers outside the initial set. Moves that produce intermediate results too trivial (like 1, 2, or 5) or that significantly constrain future options diminish promisingness. For instance, producing a result like 5 or 1 early on can limit the ability to combine towards 24 efficiently. Conversely, intermediate values that maintain flexibility\u2014such as 8, 13, or manageable combinations like 2 or 3\u2014are more promising, as they keep multiple solution routes open. Moves leading to dead-ends or impossible subsequent steps, especially those that rely on invalid operations or produce unresolvable intermediate values, should be avoided. The recent learning indicates that maintaining the"

Past attempts reveal that certain combinations and sequences lead to invalid moves or dead ends, so refining our approach is essential.\n\n**Core Principles for the Puzzle:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining the Largest Numbers (8 and 13):**  \n   The large numbers offer the most straightforward routes to approaching 24 through subtraction or multiplication. For instance, subtracting 8 from 13 yields 5, a small, manageable number that can be combined with others to reach 24. Alternatively, multiplying 8 by 2 gives 16, which is close to 24 and can be combined with other small numbers for the final step.\n\n2. **Generate Useful Small Numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6):**  \n   The small numbers facilitate fine-tuning toward 24. Subtracting or dividing larger numbers to produce these small intermediates is crucial. For example, 13 - 8 = 5 provides a small value, and 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 provides a useful factor. Creating such small numbers early allows flexible combinations later.\n\n3. **Avoid Reusing or Dropping Numbers Illegally:**  \n   Each operation consumes the two numbers involved; reusing a number without re-derivation is invalid. After a subtraction like 13 - 8 = 5, the original 13 and 8 are considered used, leaving 5 as a new number. Subsequent steps must be based solely on the current set of available numbers.\n\n4. **Focus on Valid Operations and Their Consequences:**  \n   For example, starting with 13 - 8 = 5 is valid and leaves the set {1, 2, 5}. From here, attempts to reach 24 must be carefully crafted. Combining 5 with 8 again is invalid because 8 is already used. Similarly, adding 1 or 2 to 5 to reach 24 directly is impossible, so intermediate steps are necessary.\n\n5. **Use Multiplication and Addition for Final Steps:**  \n   Once small numbers like 4, 5, or 6 are generated, multiplication can often reach 24. For instance, if you can produce 6 and 4, then",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 1, 2, 8, 13 puzzle, the primary focus is on preserving multiple pathways toward reaching 24, emphasizing flexibility and legality of operations. Promising steps are those that combine the current numbers using valid arithmetic operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014without reusing numbers improperly or creating results outside the initial set unless logically derived through valid operations. Producing intermediate results like 5 or 1 early on tends to limit future options, as these values constrain the possible combinations toward 24. Conversely, intermediate values such as 8, 13, or manageable sums like 2 or 3 tend to sustain multiple solution avenues. Moves that generate results incompatible with further valid operations\u2014like attempting to use a derived number not obtainable without reusing or invalid steps\u2014are deemed unpromising. Crucially, moves should avoid producing intermediate values that cannot be combined further to reach 24 or that"

The previous attempts highlight that certain initial steps\u2014such as subtracting 8 from 13 to get 5\u2014are valid but do not necessarily lead to a solution, especially when subsequent operations become invalid or dead-end.\n\n**Key refined strategies:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining the Largest Numbers (8 and 13):**  \n   The combination of 8 and 13 is most promising since their operations can quickly produce manageable values. Subtracting 8 from 13 yields 5, a small number that can be combined with others to approach 24. Multiplying 8 by 2 gives 16, which is close to 24; from there, adding small numbers or multiplying further can hit the target.  \n   Example:  \n   - 8 * 2 = 16  \n   - 16 + 8 = 24 (if 8 is still available) \u2014 but since 8 is used in multiplication, it\u2019s consumed, so this path is invalid unless 8 remains.\n\n2. **Generate Useful Small Numbers Early:**  \n   Creating small intermediate values like 2, 4, or 5 early on is crucial for flexible combinations later.  \n   For example:  \n   - 13 - 8 = 5 (uses 13 and 8, remaining: 1, 2, 5)  \n   - 8 \u00f7 2 = 4 (uses 8 and 2, remaining: 1, 4, 13) \u2014 but note that dividing 8 by 2 consumes both numbers, leaving 4.  \n   These small numbers can then be combined with others to reach 24, such as 4 * 6, if 6 is available, or 4 * 5, etc.\n\n3. **Respect the One-Use-Per-Operation Rule:**  \n   Each move consumes the two numbers involved. Once a number is used in an operation, it cannot be reused unless reconstructed. For example, after 13 -",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 1, 2, 8, 13 puzzle, the core principle is to prioritize operations that maintain multiple pathways toward the target number 24, emphasizing both legality and strategic flexibility. A promising move is one that combines current numbers using valid arithmetic operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014while respecting the rules of numerical reuse and correctness. Moves that produce intermediate results like 5 or 1 early on should be approached cautiously, as such results often narrow future options and can lead to dead ends, reducing the likelihood of reaching 24. Conversely, intermediate values such as 8, 13, or manageable sums like 2 or 3 tend to preserve multiple solution avenues, keeping the puzzle solvable.\n\nFrom recent learnings, it is critical to ensure each step's legality: operations must use only the remaining numbers, not reusing any number improperly or employing results outside the scope of permissible intermediate values. For example, performing 13 - 8 = 5 is valid if 13 and 8 are still available, leading to a reduced set of numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 5). Subsequent steps must then combine these remaining values through valid operations, always checking that no illegal reuse occurs. Moves that create results incompatible with further valid operations\u2014such as producing a number that cannot be combined further or that violates the rules\u2014are deemed unpromising.\n\nFurthermore, the evaluation should consider whether the resulting intermediate numbers"

Here's a refined, concise strategy tailored specifically for this set:\n\n**1. Prioritize Combining Largest and Middle-Value Numbers for Manageable Targets**  \nThe key to reaching 24 efficiently lies in leveraging the larger numbers\u20148 and 13\u2014to produce intermediate results close to 24. For instance, combining 8 and 13 through addition yields 21, which is close to 24 and can be adjusted easily with small numbers. Alternatively, multiplying 8 by 2 produces 16, which is also near 24 and can be used as a stepping stone. These operations create flexible pathways toward 24 without overly complex steps.\n\n**2. Generate Small, Flexible Numbers Early**  \nCreating small intermediate values such as 2, 3, 4, or 5 early on enhances the versatility of subsequent operations. For example, subtracting 8 from 13 yields 5, a valuable number to combine with others to approach 24. Also, dividing 8 by 2 yields 4, which can be multiplied with 6 or 5 to reach 24. Generating these small numbers early ensures multiple options for combining toward 24.\n\n**3. Respect the One-Use-Per-Operation Rule and Validity of Moves**  \nEach operation consumes the two involved numbers, which cannot be reused unless reconstructed. In the previous attempt, the move \"3 + 21 = 24\" was invalid because 21 was not derived from the current set\u20148 + 13 = 21 is valid, but the move was not executed at that stage. Therefore, always confirm that each intermediate value is legitimately obtained from the available numbers before using it in subsequent steps. Avoid combining numbers in ways that require reusing or creating numbers without proper operations.\n\n**4. Focus on Valid Sequential Operations to Reach 24**  \nAn effective sequence involves combining the original numbers to generate intermediate targets near 24, then summing or multiplying to hit exactly 24. For example:\n- Combine 8 and 13 to get 21.\n-",

Here is a refined, detailed strategy tailored specifically for this puzzle:\n\n**1. Leverage Large and Middle-Range Numbers to Create Manageable Targets**\n\nThe key to reaching 24 efficiently involves using the larger numbers\u20148 and 13\u2014to generate intermediate results close to 24, thereby simplifying the path to the target. For example:\n\n- Combining 13 and 1 through subtraction: 13 - 1 = 12. This yields a convenient intermediate near 24, which can be doubled or combined further.\n- Multiplying 8 by 2: 8 * 2 = 16, another number close to 24 that can be adjusted with small additions or subtractions.\n- Combining 8 and 13 directly via addition: 8 + 13 = 21, which is just 3 away from 24, allowing simple adjustments.\n\nPrioritizing such combinations helps create flexible pathways. For instance, generating 12, 16, or 21 early provides multiple options for reaching 24 with minimal complexity.\n\n**2. Generate Small, Versatile Intermediate Numbers Early**\n\nCreating small intermediate numbers like 2, 3, 4, or 5 early in the process enhances flexibility. For example:\n\n- Subtracting 8 from 13: 13 - 8 = 5, a useful small number.\n- Dividing 8 by 2: 8 / 2 = 4, another versatile number.\n- Subtracting 1 from 2: 2 - 1 = 1, which is already available but useful in some contexts.\n\nThese small numbers serve as building blocks to reach 24 through combinations such as multiplication or addition. For example, multiplying 4 and 6 yields 24, so generating a 6 (e.g., 8 - 2 = 6) can be advantageous.\n\n**3. Maintain Strict Adherence to the One-Use-Per-Operation Rule and Validity of Moves**\n\nA critical learning point from past attempts is ensuring that each intermediate value is legitimately obtained from the current set of numbers before using it in subsequent steps. Moves that reuse numbers, drop numbers from the current set without proper operations, or involve combining non-existent values are invalid.\n\nFor example:\n\n- When performing 13 - 1 = 12, both 13 and 1 are from the original set, so this move is valid.\n- After this move, the remaining numbers are 12, 8, and 2.\n- In subsequent steps, any new intermediate must be derived from these remaining numbers only.\n\nAvoid attempts like \"3 + 21 = 24\" unless 21 is genuinely derived from the current set, such as 13 + 8 = 21, and both 13 and 8 are available at that point.\n\n**4. Focus on Sequential, Valid Operations to Reach 24**\n\nThe most effective approach involves combining the original numbers to generate intermediate targets near 24, then combining these intermediates to hit exactly 24. Some practical pathways include:\n\n- **Pathway A:**  \n  - Step 1: 13",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the Numbers 1, 2, 8, 13 in the Game of 24\n\nIn the pursuit of efficiently solving the 24 game with the initial set {1, 2, 8, 13}, it is essential to develop a refined evaluation framework that guides move selection toward promising pathways while avoiding dead-ends. The core principles hinge on understanding the implications of each move\u2014both in the immediate results and in preserving future options\u2014and on interpreting the recent learning about the value of intermediate values and move legality.\n\n**Key Principles of the Updated Model:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Moves That Maintain Multiple Solution Pathways:**  \n   Moves should produce intermediate results that keep open several avenues toward 24. For instance, combining numbers to produce intermediate results like 8, 13, 2, or small integers such as 3 or 5 generally preserves more options than results like 1 or 5 early on, which tend to narrow the solution space. Producing larger, flexible intermediate results (e.g., 12, 24, 16) is often more promising because they can be combined with remaining numbers to reach 24 efficiently.\n\n2. **Legality and Proper Use of All Numbers:**  \n   Valid moves must use available numbers exactly once, without reuse or invalid operations. Each step should reduce the pool of remaining numbers, either by combining two to produce a new intermediate value or by using subtraction/division to reach an intermediate that can be combined later. It is critical to track which numbers have been used and which remain, ensuring that no move violates game rules.\n\n3. **Strategic Value of Intermediate Results:**  \n   Recent insights highlight that results like 5 or 1 early in the process tend to narrow options and increase dead-end risks. Conversely, producing intermediate values such as 8, 13, or 2 maintains solution flexibility. For example, generating 8 (from 2 * 4 or other operations) may open pathways to reach 24 via multiplication or addition, while results like 1 often limit subsequent steps unless they serve as divisors or additive components.\n\n4. **Avoidance of Incompatible Intermediate Values:**  \n   Moves that generate intermediate values incompatible with future valid operations\u2014such as results that cannot be combined further to reach 24\u2014are less promising. For example, producing a 5 or 7 early can be problematic unless a clear pathway to 24 exists from these values, which is often not the case.\n\n5. **Focus on Combining High-Impact Pairs First:**  \n   Since the initial set includes 1, 2, 8, and 13, pairing the largest"

Here is a concise, actionable plan tailored specifically for this set:\n\n**1. Prioritize Creating Manageable Intermediate Values Using Large and Middle Numbers**\n\nLarge and mid-range numbers like 8 and 13 provide key opportunities to generate intermediate values close to 24. For example:\n\n- Combining 13 and 1 via subtraction:  \n  **13 - 1 = 12**  \n  This yields a convenient intermediate close to 24, which can be doubled or combined with other numbers to reach 24 efficiently.\n\n- Combining 8 with 2:  \n  **8 * 2 = 16**  \n  This produces a number close to 24, allowing for straightforward addition or subtraction to reach the target.\n\n- Adding 8 and 13:  \n  **8 + 13 = 21**  \n  This is just 3 away from 24, and can be adjusted with small operations like adding 1 or subtracting 2 to achieve 24.\n\nGenerating these intermediate targets early simplifies subsequent steps, offering multiple pathways toward 24.\n\n**2. Generate Small, Versatile Numbers Early for Flexible Combinations**\n\nSmall numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are essential building blocks. Use operations to create these early:\n\n- From 13 and 8, create smaller numbers:  \n  **13 - 8 = 5**  \n  Useful for building up to 24 via multiplication or addition.\n\n- From 8 and 2, generate 4:  \n  **8 / 2 = 4**  \n  This can be combined with other small numbers to reach 24.\n\n- From 2 and 1, generate 1 (if needed):  \n  **2 - 1 = 1** (already available, but useful for certain operations).\n\nThese small numbers can combine to reach 24 through multiplication:\n\n- For example, if you can generate a 6, then:  \n  **4 * 6 = 24**\n\nCreating 6 is straightforward by subtracting 2 from 8:  \n**8 - 2 = 6**\n\n**3. Strictly Adhere to Valid, One-Use-Per-Operation Rules and Proper Intermediate Derivations**\n\nA critical learning point is ensuring each intermediate result",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the Numbers 1, 2, 8, 13 in the Game of 24\n\nTo optimize problem-solving strategies for the 24 game with the initial set {1, 2, 8, 13}, it is essential to develop a nuanced evaluation framework that informs move selection, distinguishing promising moves from those likely to lead to dead-ends. Recent insights, combined with core principles, suggest refined criteria centered on the nature of intermediate results, move legality, and the preservation of solution pathways.\n\n**1. Prioritize Moves Producing Flexible Intermediate Results**\n\nMoves should be evaluated based on whether they generate intermediate values conducive to reaching 24 efficiently. Results such as 8, 13, 12, or 2 tend to be more promising because they can be combined further to reach 24 through multiplication or addition. For example:\n\n- Generating 8 (via 2 * 4 or 1 + 7) provides a strong foothold for multiplying to 24.\n- Producing 12 (via 13 - 1) opens pathways to multiply by 2 or 3.\n- Retaining small values like 2 or 3 allows for additive adjustments toward 24.\n\nConversely, results that tend to narrow the solution space\u2014such as 1 or 5\u2014are less promising unless they can be combined effectively later. Results like 1 are especially problematic if they do not serve as divisors or additive components in subsequent steps.\n\n**2. Maintain Multiple Solution Pathways**\n\nMoves should be assessed based on their capacity to keep multiple avenues open. Combining numbers to produce intermediate results that can be further manipulated in various ways enhances the chances of reaching 24. For instance, creating an intermediate 8 provides options for multiplication (8 * 3 = 24) or addition (8 + 8 = 16), while results like 5 or 7 tend to limit subsequent options unless a clear pathway exists.\n\n**3. Strictly Adhere to Move Legality and Proper Usage**\n\nAny move must obey the rules: use each number exactly once per step, combine only available numbers, and perform valid operations. Moves that reuse numbers, drop numbers incorrectly, or introduce invalid operations are invalid and should be marked as such. Proper tracking of used and remaining numbers is crucial.\n\n**4. Avoid Incompatible or Dead-End Intermediate Values**\n\nSome intermediate results are incompatible with future steps toward 24. For example, producing 5 without a viable pathway to 24 (e.g., 5 * 4"

This refined strategy emphasizes generating manageable intermediate values, leveraging small numbers for flexible combinations, and maintaining strict adherence to valid operations, all tailored specifically for these numbers.\n\n**1. Focus on Creating Manageable Intermediate Values Using Large and Middle Numbers**\n\nGiven the numbers 8 and 13, these are prime candidates for producing intermediate targets near 24. Combining them thoughtfully can simplify reaching the goal:\n\n- **Use subtraction to generate convenient values:**  \n  Combining 13 and 1 via subtraction yields 12, a key intermediate:  \n  **13 - 1 = 12**  \n  This value is close to 24 and can be doubled or combined with other results to reach the target efficiently.\n\n- **Combine 8 with 2 to get close to 24:**  \n  Multiplying these gives:  \n  **8 * 2 = 16**  \n  which is close to 24. From 16, adding 8 or 13, or manipulating with smaller numbers, can approach 24.\n\n- **Sum 8 and 13:**  \n  **8 + 13 = 21**  \n  Only 3 away from 24, this provides a straightforward pathway:  \n  **21 + 3 = 24**  \n  where 3 can be obtained from 2 and 1 (e.g., 2 + 1 = 3).  \n  Alternatively, subtracting 1 from 8 or 13 to generate 7 or 12, then multiplying or adding, can also help.\n\nPrioritizing such intermediate targets early simplifies subsequent steps, offering multiple pathways to 24.\n\n**2. Generate Small, Versatile Numbers Early for Flexible Combinations**\n\nSmall numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are essential building blocks. Efficiently creating these early on provides flexibility:\n\n- From 13 and 8, generate 5:  \n  **13 - 8 = 5**  \n  Useful for multiplication to produce 30, which can then be manipulated toward 24.\n\n- From 8 and 2, generate 4:  \n  **",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the Numbers 1, 2, 8, 13 in the Game of 24\n\nIn tackling the 24 game with the initial set {1, 2, 8, 13}, developing a refined strategy hinges on understanding which moves are promising and which are likely dead-ends. Recent insights\u2014both from analyzed attempts and the learnings about move legality\u2014highlight critical patterns that inform effective decision-making. This model synthesizes previous principles with the latest observations to guide move evaluation comprehensively.\n\n**Core Principles for Move Evaluation**\n\n1. **Produce Flexible and Promising Intermediate Values**  \nMoves should aim to generate intermediate results that facilitate reaching 24 efficiently. Such values include:\n\n- **Multiples of 3 or 4:** Results like 12, 8, or 6 open pathways for straightforward multiplication or addition to reach 24.\n- **Values Near 24:** Results like 16, 12, or 18 serve as stepping stones, reducing the number of steps needed.\n- **Small Values (2, 3, 4):** These can be combined additively or multiplicatively to approach 24.\n\nConversely, intermediate results such as 1 or 5 tend to be less conducive unless they uniquely enable a clear pathway, which is rare.\n\n2. **Maintain Multiple Solution Pathways**  \nMoves should preserve diverse options. For example, creating an 8 allows for multiplication by 3 (8\u00d73=24) or addition with 16 (if available). Generating 12 enables multiplication (12\u00d72=24) or addition with 12. Producing such versatile intermediate results ensures that if one pathway stalls, others remain accessible.\n\n3. **Adhere Rigorously to Move Legality**  \nAny move must comply strictly with the rules:  \n- Use each number exactly once per operation.  \n- Combine only the current remaining numbers.  \n- Perform valid operations (+, -, \u00d7, \u00f7).  \n- Do not reuse or drop numbers arbitrarily.  \n- Keep accurate track of remaining numbers after each move.\n\nViolations\u2014such as reusing numbers, dropping unused numbers, or invalid operations\u2014render the move illegal and wasteful.\n\n4. **Avoid Incompatible or Dead-End Results**  \nSome intermediate values do not lead toward 24, especially if they cannot be combined further to reach the target.

Combining prior learnings with recent insights yields a refined approach tailored to these values, emphasizing valid operations, logical sequencing, and the creation of manageable intermediate targets.\n\n**Key Strategic Principles for 1, 2, 8, 13:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Creating High-Impact Intermediate Values Using Large and Middle Numbers**  \n   The numbers 13 and 8 are especially valuable for generating intermediate targets near 24. Notably, 13 minus 1 yields 12, a highly useful number because 12 is a multiple of 3, 4, and 6, providing multiple pathways toward 24.  \n   - For example: **13 - 1 = 12**  \n   Using this, one can aim to multiply or add to reach 24.  \n   \n   Similarly, multiplying 8 by 2 gives 16:  \n   - **8 * 2 = 16**  \n   From 16, adding 8 or 13, or subtracting smaller values, can get closer to 24. For instance, **16 + 8 = 24** (if 8 is still available), or combining 16 with 8 or 13 after other operations.\n\n2. **Utilize Small Numbers for Flexible Combinations**  \n   Generating small numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 early allows for versatile operations later.  \n   - For example:  \n     - From 13 and 8, generate 5: **13 - 8 = 5**  \n     - From 8 and 2, generate 4: **8 - 4** (if 4 is created), or **8 / 2 = 4**  \n     - Use 2 + 1 = 3, which can be multiplied by 8 or 12 for larger targets.\n\n3. **Leverage Direct Multiplications and Subtractions to Reach 24**  \n   With 12 and 2, the most straightforward path to 24 is:  \n   - **12 * 2 = 24**  \n   This is a direct, valid operation and often the simplest solution when the numbers align.\n\n4. **Avoid Illegal or Redundant Operations**  \n   Be cautious to only combine numbers that are present and operationally valid. For example, ensure that a number isn't used more",

Recent insights from practical attempts and the analysis of move legality reinforce these principles, which together form a comprehensive framework for assessing move viability.\n\n**1. Prioritize Generating Flexible, Promising Intermediate Values**  \nMoves should aim to produce intermediate results that simplify reaching 24. Values such as 12, 8, 6, 4, and 3 are particularly valuable because they serve as effective stepping stones. For example, forming 12 allows for straightforward multiplication (12\u00d72=24) or addition with other intermediate results. Similarly, generating 8 or 6 can facilitate multiplicative pathways to 24. Values close to or divisors of 24 (like 12 or 8) provide direct routes, reducing the number of steps needed. Conversely, results like 1 or 5 tend to be less helpful unless they unlock a unique pathway, which is rare. Focusing on moves that produce these high-potential intermediates increases the likelihood of success.\n\n**2. Maintain Multiple Solution Pathways**  \nA robust strategy involves creating intermediate results that open various routes toward 24. For instance, producing an 8 permits multiplication by 3 or addition with 16 (if possible), while generating 12 allows for multiplication by 2 or addition with other intermediates. Preserving such versatile results ensures that if one pathway becomes blocked, others remain accessible. This approach minimizes dead-ends and provides flexibility, which is critical given the limited initial numbers and the constraints of move legality.\n\n**3. Strictly Adhere to Move Legality**  \nLegal moves are fundamental to effective evaluation. Each operation must use only the remaining numbers exactly once, follow valid arithmetic rules, and avoid reusing numbers or creating invalid expressions. Violations\u2014such as reusing a number, dropping a number prematurely, or performing illegal operations\u2014waste attempts and lead to dead-ends. Rigor"

Since 12 * 2 = 24, establishing 12 early simplifies the path to the target. After this, ensure that the remaining numbers (2, 8) are available for multiplication.\n\n2. **Utilize Addition to Generate Small, Useful Numbers:**  \n   Combining 13 and 8 through addition yields 21 (13 + 8 = 21), which can be combined with other numbers in division or subtraction to approach 24. Similarly, **2 + 1 = 3** is a versatile small number that can be used as a multiplier or divisor to reach 24 from larger intermediate values.\n\n3. **Construct Intermediate Values Carefully Without Reusing or Overusing Numbers:**  \n   Once 12 is created, avoid reusing numbers or performing operations that involve numbers no longer available. For example, after obtaining 12, adding 8 yields 20, which is close but requires further manipulation. These intermediate steps should be planned to lead efficiently toward 24.\n\n4. **Leverage Multiplication Paths from Small Numbers:**  \n   From the small numbers, such as 3 (from 2 + 1) or 5 (from 13 - 8), consider multiplying by 8 or 12 (once created) to reach 24. For example, **12 * 2 = 24** is a",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 24 Game with Numbers 1, 2, 8, 13\n\nThis refined framework synthesizes prior strategic principles with recent insights from move legality and intermediate value analysis, enabling more effective decision-making tailored to the specific set {1, 2, 8, 13}. It emphasizes generating flexible, high-impact intermediate values, preserving multiple solution pathways, and strictly adhering to move legality to improve efficiency and success rates.\n\n**1. Prioritize Generating High-Impact, Versatile Intermediate Values**  \nMoves should aim to produce intermediate results that significantly simplify reaching 24. Values such as 12, 8, 6, 4, and 3 are particularly valuable because they serve as strategic stepping stones. For example:\n\n- Creating **12** (via 8 + 4 or 13 - 1) allows for straightforward multiplication by 2 (12\u00d72=24) or addition with other intermediates.\n- Generating **8** (via 8 itself or 2\u00d74) provides multiple pathways: multiplication by 3 (8\u00d73=24), addition with 16 (if obtainable), or combining with other intermediates.\n- Producing **6** (e.g., from 13 - 7 or 8 - 2) opens options like 6\u00d74=24 or 6\u00d7(some factor) to reach 24.\n- Values close to or dividing 24, such as 12 or 8, are especially strategic because they reduce the total operations needed.\n\nConversely, results like 1 or 5 tend to be less helpful unless they uniquely unlock a solution pathway, which is rare. Moves should favor producing these high-potential intermediates to increase the probability of success efficiently.\n\n**2. Maintain Multiple Solution Pathways for Flexibility**  \nCreating intermediate results that can lead to multiple solutions is crucial. For instance:\n\n- An **8** can be used in multiplication (8\u00d73=24), addition (if combined with 16), or division (if 16 or 48 are accessible).\n- A **12** can serve as a multiplier (12\u00d72=24) or be combined with"

Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step strategic framework tailored to this set, emphasizing valid operations, logical pathways, and constraints.\n\n**1. Recognize the Significance of the Initial Step (Using 13 and 1):**  \nStarting with the operation **13 - 1 = 12** is both straightforward and strategic. It produces a key intermediate (12) that can be combined with remaining numbers to reach 24 efficiently. This initial move reduces complexity and leverages the large number 13 to generate a familiar factor (12) closely related to 24 (since 12 * 2 = 24).  \n\n**2. Strictly Adhere to Remaining Numbers and Single-Use Operations:**  \nPost-initial step, the remaining numbers are 2 and 8 (since 13 and 1 are used). The critical rule is that each number can only be used once, and all operations must be valid and involve only these remaining numbers. Avoid reusing or dropping numbers, as this violates the rules and invalidates subsequent steps.\n\n**3. Focus on Creating a Path to 24 Using Remaining Numbers:**  \nFrom the remaining set (2 and 8), the most promising route involves generating intermediate values that can multiply to 24.  \n- The obvious candidate is **12**, which can be combined with 2 to produce 24 via multiplication (**12 * 2 = 24**).  \n- To reach this, the key is to generate 12 first, which was achieved initially (**13 - 1 = 12**). Now, the challenge is to incorporate 8 into the process without violating rules.\n\n**4. Avoid Invalid or Repetitive Operations:**  \nBased on recent analysis, attempts such as **(8 - 2) * 12** or **(12 / 12) * (8 + 2)** are invalid because they either reuse numbers improperly or involve operations on numbers no longer available.  \n- For example, **(8 - 2) * 12** uses 8, 2, and 12\u2014all available\u2014but the operation yields 72, not 24, so it's not a solution.  \n- **(12 / 12) * (8 + 2)** gives 10, not 24, and also involves all three numbers, but does not lead to the target.\n\n**5. Recognize Dead Ends and Limitations:**  \nGiven the constraints and the operations tested, it appears that combining 8 and 2 with the initial 12 (from",

Focus on Generating High-Impact, Flexible Intermediate Values**  \nMoves should aim to produce intermediate results that substantially simplify reaching 24. Values such as 12, 8, 6, 4, and 3 are especially valuable because they serve as key stepping stones:\n\n- **12**: Achievable via 13 - 1 or 8 + 4; it enables straightforward pathways like 12\u00d72=24 or 12 + 12 (if accessible). Producing 12 early expands options.\n- **8**: Directly available or via 2\u00d74; 8 can be multiplied by 3 (8\u00d73=24), added to other intermediates, or used in division.\n- **6**: From 13 - 7 or 8 - 2; allows multiplication such as 6\u00d74=24 or pairing with other values.\n- **4 and 3**: Useful for fine-tuning totals, especially when combined with other intermediates.\n\nAvoid results like 1 or 5 unless they unlock unique solutions, as they are less directly useful for reaching 24 efficiently"

Prioritize the Initial Use of Large Numbers to Generate Favorable Intermediates**  \nStarting with the large number 13, the most straightforward and advantageous move is:  \n- **13 - 1 = 12**  \nThis step is both legal and strategic because it produces a familiar intermediate (12) that can be directly manipulated to reach 24.

The goal is to combine these to reach 24, ideally through intermediate values that are easy to generate and manipulate.  \n- Recognize that **12 * 2 = 24** is an immediate route if you can produce 12 from the initial operation, which you already have.  \n- The challenge is integrating 8 into the process without violating rules or reusing numbers improperly.\n\n**3. Avoid Reusing or Dropping Numbers Illegally**  \nA critical insight from recent attempts is that some sequences involved reusing numbers or performing operations on numbers no longer available, leading to invalid steps.

Leverage the Initial Intermediate and Remaining Numbers to Form 24**  \nGiven that 12 is readily obtainable from 13 and 1, focus on combining 12 with 2:\n- **12 * 2 = 24** is perfect if 12 and 2 are both available",

Focus solely on the specific combination at hand, avoiding generic advice or invalid operations.\n\n**Key Strategies:**\n\n1. **Start with the Largest Number to Simplify Pathways**  \nUse the largest number, 13, to create a manageable intermediate. Subtracting 1 from 13 yields 12, a familiar and easily manipulated number:  \n- **13 - 1 = 12**  \nThis move is legal, straightforward, and reduces complexity early on. It leaves the remaining numbers {2, 8, 12} for further operations.\n\n2. **Utilize the Remaining Numbers to Reach 24 via Multiplication**  \nAfter creating 12, the immediate goal is to combine it with 2 to reach 24:  \n- **12 * 2 = 24**  \nThis is an optimal route because it directly hits the target with a simple multiplication, minimizing the risk of errors or complex intermediate steps.\n\n3. **Manage Number Usage Carefully to Avoid Illegal Reuse or Dropping**  \nEnsure each number is used exactly once unless operations explicitly allow reuse, which is typically prohibited. After the first step, only {2, 8, 12} remain.  \n- Combining 12 and 2 is valid if both are present and unused.  \n- Be cautious about involving 8 unless it contributes directly to forming 24 or necessary intermediates.\n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary or Invalid Operations on Remaining Numbers**  \nAttempts involving 8 often lead to dead ends or illegal steps. For example, operations like (8 - 2) * 12 overshoot or fail to produce 24.  \n- (8 - 2) = 6, then 6 * 12 = 72, which is too large.  \n- (8 + 2) = 10, then multiplying by other numbers doesn\u2019t reach 24 efficiently.\n\n5. **Focus on Valid, Direct Pathways to 24**  \nThe most straightforward sequence is:  \n- **13 - 1 = 12**  \n- **12 * 2 = 24**  \nThis sequence uses only two steps and valid operations, efficiently solving the",

These values serve as critical stepping stones toward 24 due to their versatility:\n\n- **12:** Easily obtained via 13 - 1 or 8 + 4; facilitates straightforward solutions such as 12\u00d72=24 or combining with other intermediates.\n- **8:** Achieved through direct calculation or multiplication (e.g., 2\u00d74); useful for multiplication to reach 24.\n- **6:** Derived from 13 - 7 or 8 - 2; supports multiplication pathways like 6\u00d74=24.\n- **4 & 3:** Fine-tuning totals; useful in addition or division to reach 24 precisely.\n\nFocusing on producing these values early enhances pathway flexibility and reduces dead ends.\n\n2. **Ensure Move Legality and Correct Number Usage:**  \nEach move must strictly use the current set of numbers resulting from previous steps, without reusing numbers unless they are recreated through operations. Moves that involve values not present in the current set are invalid. Proper bookkeeping prevents illegal moves, such as dropping numbers without replacement or re"

The previous learnings highlight key approaches:\n\n1. **Start with straightforward multiplications:**  \n   Combining smaller numbers through multiplication often yields intermediate targets close to 24. For example, 4 \u00d7 5 = 20 is a strong initial step, as it produces a large, manageable number near 24. Using 20 as a base simplifies subsequent operations.\n\n2. **Utilize addition or subtraction to fine-tune results:**  \n   After obtaining 20, consider adding or subtracting remaining numbers to reach 24. For example, adding 4 or 5 to 20 is promising, but since 4 and 5 are already used, focus on the remaining numbers (7 and 9).\n\n3. **Combine remaining numbers carefully:**  \n   From 7 and 9, explore operations that directly yield 24 or intermediates that help reach it.  \n   - 7 + 9 = 16, which is less than 24.  \n   - 9 - 7 = 2, which can be useful if combined with other results.  \n   - 7 \u00d7 3 = 21, but 3 isn't directly available unless created by dividing 9 by 3, which isn't straightforward here.  \n   - Alternatively, 7 + 9 = 16, then adding 4 or 5 (if available) could help, but since 4 and 5 are used initially, consider their placement carefully.\n\n4. **Leverage division only when it produces whole numbers:**",
                    "value_summary": "In the context of solving the 24 game with the numbers 4, 5, 7, and 9, an effective evaluation model for moves hinges on adhering to the principles of logical reduction, consistent use of original numbers, and achievable intermediate results. Promising moves are those that produce intermediate values aligning with remaining numbers or reachable targets without introducing extraneous or impossible values. Specifically, moves that combine two available numbers via valid operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) should result in numbers that either match remaining inputs or help inch closer to 24, respecting the rules of reuse or prohibition thereof.\n\nFrom the previous summary, we recognize that creating intermediate values outside the scope of the initial set\u2014such as producing non-integer results when only integers are allowed or generating numbers that are not achievable from current operands\u2014are unpromising. For example, operations like multiplying 4 and 5 to get 20 are promising, but subsequent steps must then logically incorporate remaining numbers without violating rules (e.g., reusing numbers or dropping them without justification). Any step that attempts to use a number not available from the previous state or creates an impossible intermediate value indicates an unpromising move.\n\nThe recent attempt highlights the importance of tracking remaining numbers after each step accurately. For instance, performing 4\u00d75=20 reduces the set to {7, 9, 20}, but subsequent steps must respect the actual remaining numbers and avoid reusing or dropping numbers inconsistently.

The previous attempts reveal that certain pathways are unfruitful, so refining your approach involves identifying promising operations early and avoiding impossible routes.\n\nKey insights:\n\n1. **Maximize the use of multiplication on small pairs:**  \n   Combining 4 and 5 through multiplication yields 20 (4 \u00d7 5 = 20), a strong candidate for reaching 24 with minimal steps. From 20, adding or subtracting small numbers like 4 or 7 can help approach 24. For example, 20 + 4 = 24 directly, but this uses 4 twice if not careful, so ensure each number is used once.\n\n2. **Leverage subtraction to generate manageable intermediates:**  \n   For instance, subtracting 7 from 9 yields 2 (9 - 7 = 2), which can be combined with other results to reach 24. Since 2 \u00d7 12 = 24, if you can produce 12 from remaining numbers, this pathway is promising.\n\n3. **Evaluate the feasibility of dividing to produce whole numbers:**  \n   Division should only be used when it results in integers, as fractional intermediates are less straightforward. For example, dividing 9 by 3 (if 3 is available) yields 3, which can be combined with other numbers to reach 24.\n\n4. **Prioritize operations that produce intermediates near 24:**  \n   For example, from 7 and 9, adding gives 16 (7 + 9 = 16), which is close to 24. Adding 4 or 5 to 16 could reach 24, but since those are used elsewhere, consider their placement carefully.\n\nApplying these insights to the current numbers:\n\n- Starting with 4 and 5, multiply: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20.  \n- From 20, adding 4 or 5 again isn't possible\u2014numbers are used only once\u2014so consider combining",

Promising moves produce intermediate values that align with remaining numbers or progress toward 24 without violating rules. Operations should combine available numbers via valid operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), resulting in values either present among the remaining operands or reachable toward 24. Producing values outside the scope of initial inputs\u2014such as non-integer results when integers are required, or impossible intermediate totals\u2014are unpromising. Crucially, each move must reflect the actual remaining numbers; misrepresenting or dropping numbers without justification leads to dead ends. For example, multiplying 4\u00d75=20 is promising, but subsequent steps must correctly account for remaining numbers (7 and 9). Moves that create unreachable intermediate values or"

The key is to leverage operations that generate manageable intermediates swiftly and to recognize which combinations lead to dead ends.\n\n**Refined Strategies:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Multiplication of Small Pairs to Approach 24:**\n   Combining 4 and 5 via multiplication yields 20 (4 \u00d7 5 = 20). This is a promising starting point because 20 is just 4 away from 24, allowing a simple addition of 4 (which must be used carefully to avoid reuse). Alternatively, multiplying 7 and 3 (if obtainable) or other pairs that produce results near 24 can be useful. For example, 7 + 9 = 16, which is close to 24, and adding 4 or 5 could bridge the gap, but ensure each number is used once.\n\n2. **Use Subtraction to Generate Useful Intermediates:**\n   Subtraction often creates small numbers that can be combined more flexibly. For example:\n   - 9 - 5 = 4 (a key intermediate)\n   - 7 - 4 = 3\n   - 9 - 7 = 2\n   \n   These small results (2, 3, 4) can be combined with others via multiplication or addition to reach 24. For instance, 2 \u00d7 12 = 24, so producing 12 from the remaining numbers is advantageous.\n\n3. **Evaluate Division Only When It Produces Whole Numbers:**\n   Division should be used cautiously, only when it results in integers, to avoid fractional intermediates that complicate reaching 24. For example:\n   - 9 / 3",
                    "value_summary": "In solving the 24 game with 4, 5, 7, and 9, effective moves are those that logically reduce or combine remaining numbers toward 24, respecting available operands and valid operations. Promising steps produce intermediate values that align with remaining numbers or progress toward 24 without invalid results\u2014such as non-integers or unreachable totals. Moves that generate impossible or inconsistent intermediate results, like producing values outside current operand sets or leading to dead ends, are unpromising. Accurate tracking"

Here's a refined, concise strategy tailored specifically to these numbers:\n\n**1. Focus on Generating Intermediate Values Close to 24 Using Basic Operations**\n\n- **Prioritize operations that produce intermediate results near 24:** For example, multiplying smaller pairs like 4 and 5 yields 20 (4\u00d75=20), which is just 4 away from 24. This suggests that after obtaining 20, adding 4 (which can be derived from other operations) would complete the goal. Similarly, combining numbers to produce 12 (a factor of 24) can be highly advantageous.\n\n- **Leverage subtraction to create small but useful numbers:** For instance, 9\u22125=4 is a valuable intermediate, as it directly produces a 4, which can help in reaching 24 via multiplication or addition.\n\n**2. Use Subtraction and Division Judiciously to Generate Key Intermediates**\n\n- **Subtraction to create small, manageable numbers:**\n  - 9\u22125=4\n  - 7\u22124=3\n  - 9\u22127=2\n\n- **Division only when it results in integers:** For example, 9/3=3, or 7/1=7, but avoid fractional results unless they cleanly lead to 24.\n\n**3. Exploit Multiplication to Reach or Approach 24**\n\n- After generating intermediates like 4, 3, or 2, multiply these by suitable numbers to approach 24:\n  - 4\u00d76=24 (if 6 can be generated)\n  - 3\u00d78=24 (if 8 can be formed)\n  - 2\u00d712=24 (if 12 can be formed)\n\n- Since 12 is a common intermediate (e.g., from 4\u00d73=12), focusing on creating 12 early can streamline the process.\n\n**4. Construct Key Intermediates Step-by-Step**\n\n- Use subtraction to produce 4 and 3, then multiply:\n  - 4\u00d73=12\n- Generate 8 or 6 through combinations:\n  - 4+4=8 (requires two 4s; in this case, after obtaining 4, consider how to get another 4)\n  - 9\u22125=4",

Focus on constructing key intermediate values that simplify reaching 24. \n\nStart by identifying possible pairs that produce manageable intermediates. For example, multiplying 5 and 4 yields 20 (5\u00d74=20). From 20, adding 4 again isn't valid unless the 4 is newly generated, which isn't permissible here. Instead, look to combine 7 and 9 to produce larger intermediates: 7+9=16, or 9\u22127=2. Using subtraction, generate small, useful numbers:\n- 9\u22125=4 (valid, as 9 and 5 are original)\n- 7\u22124=3\n\nThese intermediates (4, 3, 2) can be combined:\n- Multiply 3 and 8 if 8 is available, or generate 8 via addition (e.g., 4+4), but be cautious: adding 4+4 would require two 4s, which isn't allowed unless you have multiples of that number from previous steps. Since only one of each original number exists, avoid invalid duplication.\n\nInstead, focus on the following strategic steps:\n1. Use subtraction to produce small numbers: 9\u22125=",

Avoid creating duplicates by using the same number multiple times unless multiple copies are given. \n\nKey strategies include:\n\n1. Generate small intermediate values through subtraction, which can produce useful numbers like 9\u22125=4, 7\u22124=3, or 9\u22127=2. These small numbers simplify reaching 24 when combined appropriately.\n\n2. Use multiplication or addition to build larger intermediates, but only from available numbers. For example, multiplying 5\u00d74=20 is valid and close to 24, so combining it with addition or subtraction of the remaining numbers can help reach the target.\n\n3. Identify promising pairs to combine first\u2014such as 5 and 4 to get 20, or 7 and 9 to get 16\u2014then combine these intermediates with the remaining numbers to approach 24.\n\n4. Avoid invalid steps like adding a number to itself (e.g., 4+4) unless multiple copies are present. Similarly, do not reuse results from previous steps unless explicitly allowed; each operation should solely involve original numbers or valid intermediates constructed in prior steps.\n\n5. Focus on constructing key intermediates like 8, 12, 16, or 20, which can be combined via addition or subtraction to reach 24. For example, combining 20 and 4 (from 5\u00d74 and 9\u22127) gives 24.\n\n6. Always verify each step is",

Moves resulting in integers that are either too distant from 24 or produce non-integer or impossible results tend to be unpromising. Specifically, combining small numbers via addition or multiplication that approach 24\u2014such as (7 \u00d7 3) or (9 + 15)\u2014are generally promising, provided the intermediate results remain within achievable bounds.\n\nCrucially, any move that reuses numbers improperly or attempts to operate on non-existent values is invalid\u2014such as adding 4 + 4 when only one 4 exists. Such moves are 'impossible' because they violate the rule against reusing individual numbers unless explicitly available multiple times. Moves that produce fractional or non-integer intermediate values, like dividing 7 by 2, are also unpromising unless the result remains integral and useful.\n\nIn the context of the current set, moves that combine two numbers to produce an intermediate close to 24, or that reduce the problem to a smaller subset with promising targets, are more likely to lead to a solution.

The key is to leverage valid operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\u2014while respecting the rule that each original number can only be used once unless multiple copies are provided.\n\n**Focused Approach:**\n\n1. **Prioritize generating intermediate values that simplify reaching 24.**  \n   Use subtraction to create small, manageable numbers. For instance, with 9 and 5, you can compute 9\u22125=4, reducing the problem to combining 4, 7, and the remaining number 3 (if derived). These small numbers often serve as stepping stones toward 24.\n\n2. **Identify promising initial pairs.**  \n   Multiplying or adding selected pairs can produce intermediates close to 24. For example, 5\u00d74=20 is near 24, and adding 4 (from 9\u22125) or combining with other intermediates might help reach 24 efficiently.\n\n3. **Construct key intermediates like 8, 12, 16, or 20.**  \n   These values are conducive to reaching 24 through addition or subtraction. For example, combining 20 (from 5\u00d74) with 4 yields 24, which is a direct route.\n\n4. **Use subtraction to create small, flexible numbers.**  \n   For instance, 9\u22127=2 or 7\u22124=3 can be useful for building up to 24 through multiplication or addition.\n\n5. **Avoid invalid operations or reuse of results unless explicitly allowed.**  \n   Do not add a number to itself unless multiple copies exist, and do not reuse results from previous steps unless justified.\n\n**Incorporating the Latest Findings:**\n\nFrom the recent analysis, the initial step 9\u22125=4 is valid, leaving",

This set presents specific opportunities and challenges, so the key is to focus on operations and intermediate values that can reliably lead toward 24, while avoiding dead-ends.\n\n**Core Strategy Highlights:**\n\n1. **Identify impactful initial operations:**  \n   Using subtraction early can simplify the set\u2014particularly, operations like 9\u22125=4 produce small, flexible intermediates. This operation replaces larger numbers with manageable ones, reducing complexity and creating opportunities for straightforward combinations later.\n\n2. **Leverage near-miss multiplications and additions:**  \n   Recognize that products close to 24, such as 5\u00d74=20, can serve as stepping stones. Combining these with small adjustments (adding or subtracting small numbers) can bridge the gap efficiently. For example, from 20, adding 4 yields 24, so seeking ways to reach 20 early is valuable.\n\n3. **Construct strategic intermediate targets:**  \n   Focus on intermediate results that can be easily manipulated toward 24. Values like 8, 12, 16, or 20 are particularly useful because they have straightforward pathways to 24 through simple operations like multiplication or addition. For instance, multiplying 8\u00d73=24, or adding 4 to 20, are direct routes.\n\n4. **Use subtraction to create versatile small numbers:**  \n   Operations like 7\u22124=3 or 9\u22127=2 generate small, flexible numbers. These can be multiplied or added with other intermediates to reach 24. For example, 3\u00d78=24 or 4\u00d76=24, where 6 can be derived from other combinations.\n\n5. **Prioritize valid, non-redundant operation sequences:**  \n   Only reuse numbers when multiple copies are permissible. Avoid reusing the same number or intermediate unless explicitly allowed, as this can lead to invalid solutions and wasted effort.\n\n6. **Early elimination of dead-ends:**  \n   Carefully analyze whether intermediate steps can feasibly lead to 24. If a sequence results in numbers that cannot combine to reach 24 (e.g., large numbers without straightforward pathways), discard that route early to save time.\n\n---\n\n**Applying the refined strategy to the specific set 4, 5, 7, 9:**\n\n- Starting with the operation **9\u22125=4** simplifies the set to 4, 7, 4.  \n- From here, explore possible formulas:\n\n   - **4 + 7 = 11:**  \n     Not directly 24, but close to half of 24. Combining 11 with other results might help,",

Here\u2019s an optimized, step-by-step approach rooted in recent learnings:\n\n1. **Prioritize impactful initial operations:**  \n   Begin by exploring operations that simplify the set or produce intermediate values close to key targets. For example, subtracting 5 from 9 yields 4 (9\u22125=4), which creates a small, flexible number. This reduces the complexity of subsequent steps and opens pathways toward 24.\n\n2. **Generate small, versatile numbers through subtraction:**  \n   Use subtraction to produce small integers\u2014such as 7\u22124=3\u2014since these can serve as multipliers or addends to reach 24. Be mindful that each operation must use only the current remaining numbers; avoid reusing the same number unless multiple copies are allowed.\n\n3. **Identify near-miss products and their complements:**  \n   Look for products close to 24, like 5\u00d74=20, which requires only a small addition (adding 4) to reach 24. Alternatively, 7\u00d73=21 can be adjusted with +3, but creating 3 is essential; thus, generating 3 early via subtraction (e.g., 7\u22124=3) is a useful step.\n\n4. **Construct intermediate targets with straightforward pathways:**  \n   Values like 8, 12, 16, or 20 are strategic because they connect directly to 24 through simple operations. For instance, 20 + 4=24 or 8\u00d73=24. Achieving these intermediates involves combining earlier small numbers with multiplication or addition.\n\n5. **Use subtraction to create flexible small numbers:**  \n   Operations such as 9\u22127=2 or 5\u22124=1 can produce 2 or 1, which are valuable for multiplying to reach 24. For example, ",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for 4, 5, 7, 9 Puzzle:\n\nEffective moves are those that produce intermediate results close to 24 or streamline the path toward it, emphasizing integer outcomes and manageable operations. Moves that generate awkward fractions, non-integer results, or impossible states\u2014such as division leading to fractions that cannot be combined further\u2014are unpromising. For example, subtracting or adding numbers to create a near-24 total, or combining larger numbers to reduce complexity, tends to be beneficial. Conversely, moves that do not reduce the problem size meaningfully or lead to dead ends are less promising.\n\nFrom recent analysis, it\u2019s clear that each step must use only the current set of numbers and reduce the count by one, avoiding illegal operations or misusing available numbers. For instance, subtracting 4 from 7 to get 3 is promising because it simplifies the set to 3, 5, 9, maintaining feasible options toward 24. Moves"

Focus on only using the original numbers in each step, avoiding any operations that introduce or rely on intermediate values not derived directly from the set.\n\n**Key insights:**\n\n1. **Avoid incorrect use of derived numbers:**  \n   Operations like 7\u00d73 are invalid unless 3 is explicitly generated from the original set (e.g., 7\u22124=3). Do not assume or create numbers not directly obtainable from the initial set.\n\n2. **Create small, flexible numbers early:**  \n   Use subtraction to produce 1, 2, or 3, which are critical for reaching 24 via multiplication or addition. For example, 5\u22124=1 or 9\u22127=2. These small numbers can serve as multipliers to reach intermediate targets.\n\n3. **Target intermediate multiples of 4 or 6:**  \n   Since 24 factors into 6\u00d74 or 3\u00d78, aim to produce these factors early. For instance, 4\u00d76=24. To get 6, combine 2 and 3 (both obtainable through subtraction). To get 8, consider combining 4 with 2 or 1, or multiplying small numbers.\n\n4. **Leverage multiplication of small numbers:**  \n   Combining 2 and 4 yields 8; combining 3 and 8 yields 24 if you can produce 3 and ",

Effective moves generate intermediate results near 24 or reduce the remaining operations needed. Focus on operations that produce integers and manageable fractions; avoiding complex or awkward fractional results that hinder further progress.\n\nKey principles include:\n\n1. **Use available numbers only once per move**; avoid combining numbers in ways that \"drop\" or \"introduce\" values not originally present unless intentionally generating intermediate targets.\n\n2. **Target operations that bring the current total closer to 24**, such as adding or subtracting combinations that approximate 24 (e.g., 9 + 7 + 5 + ...). Moves that produce results significantly distant from 24 are less promising unless they set up a straightforward subsequent step.\n\n3. **Simplify the set**: Subtracting or dividing to create smaller, more manageable numbers often simplifies the path. For example, subtracting 4 from 7 yields 3, which can be more easily combined with remaining numbers.\n\n4. **Avoid moves leading to fractions that cannot be combined further**\u2014e.g., dividing to produce fractions that don't align with remaining integers or that complicate the solution.\n\n5. **Illegal or invalid operations**\u2014such as using a result not"

                    "summary": "Refined Strategy for Solving the 24 Puzzle with Numbers 4, 5, 7, 9\n\nTo effectively solve the 24 puzzle with the numbers 4, 5, 7, and 9, it is crucial to adhere strictly to the rules: only use each of the original numbers once per expression, and only combine numbers through valid arithmetic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7). No intermediate numbers are to be introduced unless they are directly derived from the initial set in a single operation, and reusing numbers or dropping them improperly invalidates the solution. Recent feedback emphasizes the importance of verifying each step's legality and focusing on intermediate values that facilitate reaching 24 efficiently.\n\n**Core Principles for the 4, 5, 7, 9 Puzzle:**\n\n1. **Use Only Original Numbers in Each Step:**  \n   Every operation must involve numbers from the initial set. For example, creating 2 by subtracting 7\u22125=2 is valid, but attempting to multiply 4\u00d72 to get 8 is only valid if 2 was directly derived from the original numbers in a previous step. Avoid assuming or introducing intermediate values that are not explicitly generated from the original set.\n\n2. **Create Small, Flexible Intermediate Numbers Early:**  \n   Subtraction often yields small numbers like 1, 2, or 3, which are instrumental in reaching 24 via multiplication or addition. For example, 5\u22124=1 or 9\u22127=2. These small numbers serve as multipliers or addends to reach target factors.\n\n3. **Target Key Factors of 24 (4, 6, 8, 12):**  \n   Recognize that 24 can be factored into 6\u00d74, 3\u00d78, or 12\u00d72. Producing these factors early streamlines the path to 24. For instance, if you can generate 6 and 4, their product yields 24 directly. Similarly, producing 8 or 12 enables different routes.\n\n4. **Leverage Multiplication of Small Numbers to Reach Larger Values:**  \n   Combining small derivations like 2 and 4 to produce 8, or 3 and 8 to get 24, is often the most direct route. For example, if you can derive 3 and 8 from the initial set, their product is 24.\n\n5. **Prioritize Operations that Lead to 24 Quickly:**  \n   Focus",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 4, 5, 7, 9 Puzzle\n\nWhen analyzing potential moves involving the numbers 4, 5, 7, and 9, focus on the following core principles to determine promising versus unpromising steps:\n\n1. **Adherence to Original Numbers:** Only utilize each original number once per move. Avoid combining or generating intermediate values using numbers not present in the initial set unless explicitly justified by prior valid steps. For example, creating a '2' from 4 and 5 is invalid unless those numbers have been legitimately combined earlier, and subsequent steps must reflect the current set accurately.\n\n2. **Progress Towards 24:** Prioritize operations that move the current total closer to 24. Moves that produce results near 24 (e.g., 23, 25) are more promising, especially if they set up straightforward final steps. Conversely, moves resulting in values far from 24 (e.g., 2, 10, 30) are less promising unless they simplify the remaining operations significantly.\n\n3. **Intermediate Result Manageability:** Favor operations that produce manageable, preferably integer, intermediate results. For example, subtracting 4 from 7 yields 3, which is easier to work with than complex fractions. Avoid moves that generate awkward fractions or non-integer results that cannot be easily combined with remaining numbers.\n\n4. **Fractional Operations and Compatibility:** When division is involved, ensure that the division results in integers or fractions that can logically be combined with remaining numbers. Avoid dividing to produce fractions that do not align with the current set or that"

Recent attempts highlight the importance of strict adherence to the rule that each original number can only be used once per operation, and all intermediate steps must derive directly from these initial numbers.\n\nKey insights:\n\n1. **Prioritize Creating Small, Flexible Intermediates:**  \n   Operations like 9\u22125=4 produce a small number (4), which can be combined with other small numbers to reach 24. For example, if you can generate 3 or 2 through subtraction or division, these can be multiplied to get larger factors of 24.\n\n2. **Use Subtraction to Generate 1, 2, or 3 Early:**  \n   For instance, 5\u22124=1 or 9\u22127=2. Small numbers like 1, 2, and 3 are crucial for composing the factors of 24 (which include 3, 4, 6, 8, 12). These small intermediates often serve as multipliers, simplifying the process.\n\n3. **Focus on Producing Factors of 24:**  \n   Recognize that 24 factors into 6\u00d74, 3\u00d78, or 12\u00d72. Generating these factors early allows for straightforward multiplication to reach 24. For example, deriving 3 and 8 enables a direct product: 3\u00d78=24.\n\n4. **Leverage Multiplication of Small Numbers:**  \n   Combining small intermediates like 2 and ",

Focus on moves that bring the current total closer to 24; values like 23 or 25 are promising, whereas results far from 24 (e.g., 2, 10, 30) are less advantageous unless they simplify subsequent steps. Favor operations yielding manageable, preferably integer, intermediate results\u2014subtracting 4 from 7 to get 3, for example, is easier to work with than awkward fractions. When division is used, ensure it produces integer results or fractions compatible with remaining numbers, avoiding divisions that generate fractional values difficult to incorporate into the final solution. Crucially, avoid moves that lead to impossible states, such as attempting to proceed after invalid steps (e.g"

Recent attempts reveal that generating small numbers like 1, 2, or 3 early is crucial because these serve as building blocks for key factors of 24 (such as 3, 4, 6, 8, 12). For example, operations like 9\u22125=4 produce a versatile small number that can be combined with others to reach 24 through multiplication.\n\nIt's essential to prioritize generating these small intermediates via subtraction or division, ensuring each original number is used once per operation. For instance, subtracting 5 from 9 yields 4, which is directly useful. Similarly, creating 2 via 9\u22127=2 or 5\u22123=2 (if 3 is available) helps form factors like 6 (2\u00d73) or 12 (4\u00d73). Recognizing that 24 factors into 6\u00d74, 3\u00d78, or 12\u00d72 guides the path: if you can produce 3 and 8, multiply for 24 directly.\n\nIn the recent attempt, the step 9\u22125=4 leaves remaining numbers 3 and 4, which cannot combine to produce 24 through basic operations. This highlights the importance of planning intermediate steps to generate a necessary factor (like 3 or 8) early on, rather than settling prematurely.\n\n",

Recent attempts reveal that creating small, versatile numbers such as 1, 2, or 3 early on significantly increases the likelihood of forming 24 through multiplication or addition because these serve as foundational building blocks for key factors of 24 (namely 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12).\n\nA critical insight is to generate these small intermediates via subtraction or division from the original numbers, ensuring each number is used only once per operation. For example, subtracting 5 from 9 yields 4, which can be directly useful for forming factors like 12 or 24 when multiplied by other numbers. Similarly, subtracting 7 from 9 yields 2, which is a valuable factor, especially when combined with 3 to produce 6 or 12.\n\nIn practice, early steps should aim to produce these small numbers:\n\n- From 9 and 5, subtract: 9\u22125=4 (useful for forming 12 or 24).\n- From 9 and 7, subtract: 9\u22127=2 (a useful factor for forming 6, 12, or 24).\n- From 7 and 5, subtract: 7\u22125=2 (reinforcing the importance of creating 2).\n- From 9 and 4, subtract: 9\u22124=5 (though this duplicates a known number, be cautious about reuse).\n\nOnce small factors like 2 and 4 are established, the next focus is to generate 3 or 8, which directly help reach 24:\n\n- To generate 3, consider if 6 can be created via 2\u00d73. Since 2 is available, the goal is to produce 3 directly or indirectly.\n- To generate 8, aim to multiply 2\u00d74, both of which can be produced from earlier steps.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to remember that producing 3 early on is advantageous because it allows the formation of 6 (2\u00d73) or 12 (4\u00d73), which are divisors",

Focus on operations that bring the total closer to 24, especially targeting intermediate results like 23 or 25, as these are more promising stepping stones. Aim for intermediate results that are integers or simple fractions, facilitating further calculations toward 24. Avoid steps that create dead ends or impossible states, such as remainders or non-usable remainders that cannot combine effectively. Refrain from repeating numbers or using invalid operations that break the logical flow. Recognize that certain combinations,"

The previous steps successfully identified that multiplying the two 3s yields 9, which is promising since 9 can help reach 24. Next, subtracting 7 from 9 gives 2, a useful intermediate. The critical mistake was attempting to divide 12 by 3 after that, which was invalid because the previous step left only 2 and 12, and 3 was not available anymore. Therefore, avoid reusing numbers or operations that involve numbers no longer present. Instead, explore combining 12 with either 3 or 7 in ways that yield 24 directly or through intermediate steps, such as adding or multiplying to reach near 24. For example, consider multiplying 12 by 2 (if 2 is obtained) or using addition/subtraction to align with 24. Remember that operations must strictly use current numbers;",

This step is valid and uses each number only once.\n\nAfter obtaining 5 (from 12 - 7), the remaining numbers are 5, 3, and 3. To reach 24, consider combining the two 3s:  \n- \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\).  \n\nNow, combine 5 and 9:  \n- \\(5 \\times 4 = 20\\) is impossible unless we derive 4 from the remaining numbers.  \n- Alternatively, if we can get 6 from the remaining numbers, since \\(4 \\times 6 = 24\\).

Moves are promising when they derive intermediate values solely through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division applied directly to existing numbers without introducing external values or hypothetical constructs. For example, subtracting 7 from 12 to obtain 5 is valid because both numbers are available in the current set; this results in a new set (3, 3, 5) that accurately reflects the previous step\u2019s numbers. Conversely, moves that attempt to produce or rely on numbers not present in the current set\u2014such as creating a 2 without explicit derivation\u2014are invalid, as they violate the rule of using only available numbers. Reusing a number multiple times without re-deriving it from the current set also breaches the rules; each number can only be used as many times as it appears initially unless explicitly combined or transformed in the current step. Effective moves should aim to generate intermediate values that are closer to 24 and useful in subsequent steps. Values like 9"

Moves that attempt to generate or rely on numbers not present in the current set\u2014such as dividing 12 by 2 when 2 is not derived from prior steps\u2014are invalid, as they violate the rule of using only existing numbers.

Analyzing past attempts reveals that certain combinations\u2014particularly those involving addition or subtraction of the larger number 12\u2014can simplify the problem significantly.\n\nFirst, consider the potential to combine 12 with one of the 3s. Since 12 + 3 = 15 is a valid operation using the original numbers (both 12 and one 3), it provides a promising starting point. This step reduces the problem to working with the remaining numbers: 15 (from 12 + 3) and the other 3 and 7 still unpaired.\n\nFrom here, the goal is to manipulate these numbers to reach 24 efficiently. For example, once you have 15, subtracting 7 yields 8 (15 - 7 = 8), which is valid and uses the original numbers without reuse. The leftover numbers after this operation are 8 (from 15 - 7) and 3 (the remaining 3). Now, adding these gives 11 (8 + 3), which is close but not directly helpful. Instead, consider alternative operations to get closer to 24.\n\nAnother promising route involves combining 12 and 3 to produce 15, then adding the other 3 to reach 18, and finally combining with 7 or other operations to arrive at 24. For example:\n\n- 12 + 3 = 15  \n- 15 + 3 = 18  \n- 18 + 6 (obtained by 7 - 1, but we lack a 1) \u2014 this complicates the approach, so perhaps better to consider different operations.\n\nAlternatively, focus on creating 4 from the original numbers, which can then be multiplied by 6 to reach 24:\n\n- 7 - 3 = 4 (valid, using 7 and 3)  \n- Then, if we can generate 6 from the remaining numbers, multiplying 4 by 6 yields 24.\n\nTo generate 6 from remaining numbers (3 and 12), consider:\n\n- 12 divided by 2 \u2014 but we don't have a 2 directly.  \n- Or, use the other 3 and 12: 12 / 2 is invalid, but 3 + 3 = 6. Since we have two 3s, they can be combined:\n\n- 3 + 3 = 6\n\nNow, the sequence is:\n\n- 7 - 3 = 4  \n- 3 + 3",

The previous strategies emphasized leveraging large numbers early\u2014particularly the 12\u2014to simplify the problem, and exploring combinations that produce intermediate targets close to 24. The key is to identify operations that reduce complexity and facilitate reaching 24 through manageable intermediate steps.\n\nIn this particular case, a promising initial step involves combining the large number 12 with one of the 3s. Since 12 + 3 = 15 is a straightforward operation using the original numbers, it provides a solid starting point. This step reduces the problem to working with 15, the remaining 3, and 7. The goal then becomes to manipulate these remaining numbers to reach 24, often by creating intermediate totals like 6, 8, or 12, which can be multiplied or added to reach 24 efficiently.\n\nOne effective pathway is to generate 6 from the remaining 3s, which are naturally available. Combining the two 3s through addition yields 6 (3 + 3). Once 6 is established, multiplying by 4 (which can be created by subtracting 3 from 7, i.e., 7 - 3 = 4) gives 24 (6 x 4). The steps are as follows:\n\n1. 12 + 3 = 15 (using 12 and one 3) \u2014 preserves original numbers; **sure**  \n2. 7 - 3 = 4 (using 7 and the other 3) \u2014 **sure**  \n3. 3 + 3 = 6 (using remaining 3s) \u2014 **sure**  \n4. 6 x 4 = 24 (multiplying the results from previous steps) \u2014 **sure**\n\nThis sequence utilizes only the initial numbers without reusing any, respects the rules, and directly produces 24. It aligns with the overarching strategy of combining larger numbers early and creating intermediate targets conducive to reaching 24.\n\nHowever, the previous attempt and feedback highlight an alternative approach involving subtracting 7 from 12, resulting in 5, and then attempting further steps to reach 24. For instance, the step:\n\n- 12 - 7 = ",

Moves that generate intermediate values not directly obtainable from the current set via legitimate operations are invalid. For example, subtracting 7 from 12 yields 5, which is valid and reduces the set accordingly. The goal is to systematically reduce the set toward the target (24) by selecting moves that produce intermediate results conducive to reaching the target without generating impossible or extraneous values. Moves should be judged based on their potential to progress toward 24, avoiding steps that produce intermediate values that cannot be"

Combining 12 with other numbers to create intermediate targets simplifies the problem. For example, subtracting or adding to 12 to produce convenient totals (like 5 or 15) can open pathways to 24 through multiplication or addition.\n\n**Key Insight 2: Use Remaining Small Numbers to Generate Useful Factors**  \nThe two 3s are versatile. Adding them yields 6, a useful multiplier for reaching 24 (since 6 x 4 = 24). Creating 4 from the remaining numbers is essential; subtracting 3 from 7 gives 4 (7 - 3 = 4). This aligns with the previous successful approach: combine 3 + 3 = 6, and create 4 from 7 and 3.\n\n**Key Insight 3: Construct Intermediate Values to Reach 24**  \nCreating intermediate totals like 6 and 4 allows straightforward multiplication: 6 x 4 = 24. The sequence involves:\n\n- Combining 3 + 3 = 6  \n- Creating 4 via 7 - 3 = 4  \n- Multiplying 6 x 4 = 24\n\nThis approach respects the rules of using each original number exactly once and avoids reusing numbers improperly.\n\n**Insights from Recent Attempt (Using 12 - 7 = 5)**  \nSubtracting 7 from 12 yields 5, leaving the set {5, 3, 3}. While this is a legal move, progressing from 5, 3, 3 to 24 is less straightforward because:\n\n- 5 x 3 = 15, and 15 x 3",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 3, 3, 7, 12 Puzzle:\n\nWhen assessing potential moves, focus on combining any two numbers from the current set using valid operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Each move should produce a new number that replaces the two used numbers, maintaining the integrity of the set. Critical to this process is ensuring that the intermediate results are legitimate and achievable from the current numbers, avoiding impossible or extraneous values that do not logically follow from previous steps. For this specific puzzle, the most promising moves are those that generate intermediate values conducive to reaching 24\u2014such as 8, 12, or 6\u2014since these can be combined efficiently later. For example, subtracting 7 from 12 yields 5, which is a valid intermediate and reduces the set to 5, 3, 3, providing a promising pathway. Conversely, moves that produce intermediate values difficult to incorporate into the target solution (e.g., 1 or 11) are less promising"

The key is to strategically utilize the large number (12), leverage the small numbers (the two 3s), and create intermediate values that facilitate reaching 24 within the rules.\n\n**1. Prioritize the Use of 12 as a Foundation**  \nSince 12 is the largest number, it serves as a strong starting point. Operations involving 12\u2014such as subtracting or dividing\u2014can quickly generate manageable intermediate values. For instance, subtracting 7 from 12 yields 5 (12 - 7 = 5), leaving the numbers 5, 3, and 3. This step is valid and sets up subsequent operations without violating game rules. Using 12 early allows for flexible pathways to 24 by combining it with other numbers or intermediate results.\n\n**2. Create Useful Intermediate Values from the Small Numbers**  \nThe two 3s are highly versatile. Combining them through addition produces 6 (3 + 3), which is directly useful because multiplying 6 by 4 results in 24. To generate 4, consider the relation between 7 and 3: subtracting 3 from 7 yields 4 (7 - 3 = 4). These intermediate results\u20146 and 4\u2014can then be multiplied to reach 24 (6 x 4 = 24). This approach is straightforward, adheres to the rules, and minimizes complexity.\n\n**3. Sequence for a Successful Solution**  \nA proven sequence involves:\n- Combining the two 3s: 3 + 3 = 6.\n- Creating 4 from 7 and 3: 7 - 3 = 4.\n- Multiplying these: 6 x 4 = 24.\n\nThis sequence uses each number exactly once and leverages their natural relationships. It is efficient and minimizes unnecessary operations.\n\n**4. Alternative Path Using the Large Number (12)**  \nAnother viable approach involves the number 12:\n- Subtract 7 from 12: 12 - 7 = 5, leaving",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 3, 3, 7, 12 Puzzle:\n\nEffective moves are those that generate intermediate results closely aligned with key target numbers\u2014such as 6, 8, 12, or 24\u2014that facilitate reaching the goal efficiently. Combining pairs to produce these \"friendly\" intermediate values allows for smoother subsequent operations and reduces complexity. For example, subtracting 7 from 12 yields 5, which can connect to other operations, or adding 3 and 3 to reach 6, a versatile stepping stone. Moves resulting in awkward or hard-to-incorporate numbers\u2014like 1, 11, or other non-target intermediates\u2014should be avoided, as they tend to hinder progress. Each operation must be valid: no reuse or improper removal of numbers, and results must accurately reflect legitimate calculations from the current set. Moves that produce impossible or extraneous values\u2014such as using a number more times than available or generating unreachable figures\u2014are unpromising.

For example, subtract 7 from 12:  \n\\[12 - 7 = 5\\]  \nThis step is valid and leaves you with the remaining numbers: 5, 3, 3. Using 12 early simplifies the pathway to 24 because it reduces complexity and opens straightforward routes to the target.\n\n**2. Use the Small Numbers (Three and Three) to Create Key Intermediate Values**  \nThe pair of 3s are highly versatile. Their sum, 3 + 3 = 6, is directly useful because multiplying 6 by 4 yields 24. To generate 4 without introducing extraneous operations, look for relations among the remaining numbers. Notably, subtracting 3 from 7 yields 4:  \n\\[7 - 3 = 4\\]  \nThis allows you to generate 4 directly from the original numbers. These intermediate values\u20146 from the two 3s and 4 from 7 and 3\u2014are crucial building blocks.\n\n**3. Construct the Solution Using These Intermediates**  \nA reliable sequence involves:\n- Combining the two 3s:  \n\\[3 + 3 = 6\\]  \n- Creating 4 from 7 and 3:  \n\\[7 - 3 = 4\\]  \n- Then, multiply these results:  \n\\[6 \\times 4 = 24\\]  \n\nThis sequence uses each number exactly once:\n- The 3s are combined for 6.\n- 7 and 3 are used to produce 4.\n- The multiplication yields 24.\n\n**4. Alternative Path Considering the Number 12**  \nAlternatively, start from the large number:  \n\\[12 - 7 = 5\\]  \nRemaining numbers: 5, 3, 3.  \nFrom here, notice that \\( (5 + 3) \\times 3 = 24 \\). This is valid because:\n- Sum 5 + 3 = 8\n- Multiply by 3: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24\n\nThis approach uses the remaining numbers efficiently and adheres strictly to game rules.\n\n**5.

Using this operation is crucial because it involves the large number 12 directly, creating a manageable intermediate value that can lead toward 24.\n\nNext, work with the remaining numbers: 3, 3, and 5.

Combining pairs to generate these \"friendly\" intermediates simplifies subsequent steps; for example, adding the two 3s to get 6 or subtracting 7 from 12 to produce 5 creates useful stepping stones. Moves resulting in awkward, non-target numbers (like 1 or 11) tend to hinder progress and should be avoided. Valid moves must strictly adhere to game rules: no reuse beyond the available counts, and each operation must use only the current set of numbers without introducing invalid intermediate values. In the context of 3, 3, 7, 12, choosing operations that produce intermediate totals close to these strategic targets helps streamline the path toward 24"

Operations involving 12 often lead to manageable intermediate values. For example, dividing 12 by 3 to get 4 or multiplying it by 2 (if available) can rapidly progress toward 24.\n\n2. **Utilize the Subtract Operation with Large Numbers:** The initial move of subtracting a smaller number from a larger number (e.g., 7 - 3 = 4) is promising because it produces a small, useful intermediate value (4), which can combine effectively with other numbers.\n\n3. **Avoid Invalid Reuse or Dropping Numbers:** Each number must be used exactly once, and operations should only combine current remaining values. Reusing previous results improperly, such as combining a result from a prior step with an already used number, leads to invalid formulas.\n\n4. **Target Small, Useful Intermediate Values:** Generating values like 4 or 6 from the original numbers enables straightforward multiplication to reach 24, as 24 factors into 4 \u00d7 6 or 6 \u00d7 4.\n\n**Refined Strategy for 3, 3, 7, 12:**\n\n1. **Start with a Valid Operation Involving the Largest Number:**\n\n   - Perform: `12 \u00f7 3 = 4`  \n     *Remaining numbers:* 3, 7, and 4\n\n   - Alternatively, `12 - 3 = 9`, but this doesn\u2019t directly help reach 24 as efficiently.\n\n2. **Create a Useful Intermediate:**\n\n   - If choosing `12 \u00f7 3 = 4`, then the remaining numbers are 3, 7, and 4.\n   \n   - Next, combine the remaining 3 and 7:\n   \n     - `7 - 3 = 4`  \n       *Remaining numbers:* 4, 4\n\n3. **Use the Remaining 4s to Reach 24:**\n\n   - Multiply the two 4s:\n   \n     - `4 \u00d7 4 = 16` \u2014 this is close but not enough.\n   \n   - Alternatively, if we can generate 6 from remaining numbers, it might help.\n\n4",

Here is a refined, actionable approach tailored specifically to these numbers:\n\n**1. Prioritize Operations Involving the Largest Number (12):**  \nLeverage 12 early by combining it with smaller numbers to produce manageable intermediate values. Dividing 12 by one of the 3s yields 4 (`12 \u00f7 3 = 4`), which is a key step because 4 is a useful factor in reaching 24. This move reduces complexity and aligns with the goal of reaching 24 through multiplication or addition involving small, simple numbers.\n\n**2. Generate Small, Useful Intermediate Values:**  \nCreating values like 4 or 6 allows straightforward multiplication to reach 24. For example, from 12 and 3, obtaining 4 sets the stage for subsequent steps. Similarly, combining remaining numbers to produce 6, 8, or 12 can facilitate easy multiplication.\n\n**3. Use Subtraction to Simplify and Create Beneficial Values:**  \nSubtracting a smaller number from a larger one often yields a small, manageable number. For instance, `7 - 3 = 4` produces a 4, which can pair with the previously obtained 4 (from `12 \u00f7 3`) to reach 16 (`4 \u00d7 4`). Alternatively, subtracting 3 from 7 gives 4, which combined with other operations can lead toward 24.\n\n**4. Be Mindful of the Usage of Each Number:**  \nEnsure each number is used exactly once. Do not reuse or drop numbers; each operation must involve remaining numbers or previously derived valid results. For example, after using 12 in a division, the remaining numbers are 3, 7, and whatever result was obtained.\n\n**5. Explore Combinations That Reach 24 Through Multiplication:**  \nMultiplying intermediate results like 4 and 6 or 8 can directly produce 24. To do this, focus on creating these values through addition or multiplication of the remaining numbers. For example, if you can produce 6 from 3 and 2 (which requires creating 2 through division or subtraction), then multiplying 4 and 6",

Here is a refined, targeted approach tailored to these numbers:\n\n1. **Leverage 12 Early with Division to Simplify:**  \nStarting with the largest number, 12, is advantageous. Dividing 12 by one of the 3s gives 4 (`12 \u00f7 3 = 4`). This step is both legal and productive, as it produces a manageable intermediate value. After this move, the remaining numbers are 3, 7, and the result 4.\n\n2. **Create Useful Intermediate Values Through Subtraction and Division:**  \nFrom the remaining numbers (3, 7, and 4), aim to generate values like 6, 8, or 12, which are directly useful in reaching 24 through multiplication. For instance, subtracting the remaining 3 from 7 yields 4 (`7 - 3 = 4`), which pairs nicely with the previously obtained 4. Alternatively, dividing 7 by 3 yields approximately 2.33, which is less straightforward unless combined with other operations.\n\n3. **Focus on Generating 6 or 8 to Reach 24 via Multiplication:**  \n- To create 6, combine 3 and 2 (which can be obtained by dividing 6 by 3, but since 6 isn't directly available, look for other ways).  \n- To create 8, consider adding 4 and 4, or multiplying 2 by 4, but these depend on generating 2 or 4 from the remaining numbers.  \n- For example, after obtaining 4 from `12 \u00f7 3`, if you can generate another 4 or 6 from the remaining numbers, multiplying these results will give 24.\n\n4. **Use Subtraction to Generate Small Numbers or Adjust Values:**  \nSubtracting larger from smaller numbers often yields small, manageable values. For example, `7 - 3 = 4`. This is useful because combining two 4s through multiplication yields 16, which is close to 24, and can be adjusted further with addition or division.\n\n5. **Ensure Correct Usage of Each Number:**  \nAt every step, verify that each number is used exactly once and that subsequent operations are based solely on the remaining numbers after previous moves. This prevents illegal moves, such as reusing or dropping numbers without proper derivation.\n\n6. **Combine Intermediate Results Effectively:**  \nOnce small, useful numbers are generated (like 4,",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for Solving the 3, 3, 7, 12 Puzzle in the Game of 24\n\nIn tackling the 3, 3, 7, 12 puzzle, effective move selection hinges on generating intermediate values that serve as strategic stepping stones toward 24. Moves that produce intermediate results close to key targets\u2014such as 6, 8, 12, or 24\u2014are particularly valuable, as they simplify subsequent calculations. For example, combining the two 3s to form 6 or subtracting 7 from 12 to get 5 creates advantageous intermediates that facilitate reaching 24 efficiently.\n\nConversely, moves resulting in awkward or non-strategic numbers\u2014like 1, 11, or other values that do not align with the goal trajectory\u2014tend to complicate progress. Such values often lead to dead-ends or require additional steps that do not directly contribute to reaching 24. Therefore, evaluating potential moves should prioritize those that yield \"friendly\" intermediate totals, enabling smoother pathways to the target.\n\nLegal operation adherence is paramount. Each move must strictly use the current set of available numbers without reusing or dropping numbers improperly. In the specific case of 3, 3, 7, 12, initial moves like 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 are valid and produce promising intermediates. For instance, after performing 12 \u00f7 3 = 4, the remaining numbers are 3 and 4, which can then be combined with other numbers to approach 24 more directly (e.g., 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, then 12 \u00d7 2). Any attempt to perform operations that use numbers not present in the current set or to repeat operations on the same number without proper re-availability invalidates the move and hampers progress.\n\nRecent insights emphasize the importance of move legality and the quality of resulting intermediates.

Focused approaches that prioritize operations involving the largest number and aim to create intermediate values conducive to reaching 24 will streamline the process.\n\n**Key Strategies:**\n\n1. **Leverage the 12 via Division:**  \nStart by dividing 12 by one of the 3s to generate a simple, manageable number:  \n`12 \u00f7 3 = 4`  \nThis move reduces complexity early, producing a 4 and leaving behind the numbers 3 and 7. This step is both legal and effective, setting a foundation for subsequent operations.\n\n2. **Create Repetitive Useful Values (Especially 4):**  \nGenerating multiple 4s is advantageous because multiplication of two 4s yields 16, which is close to 24. From the leftover 3 and 7, consider:  \n- `7 - 3 = 4` (another 4)  \n- Or, combining `12 \u00f7 3` (from above) with `7 - 3` to get two 4s.  \nHaving two 4s allows the calculation:  \n`4 \u00d7 4 = 16`  \nwhich is a solid step toward 24, as `16 + 8 = 24`.\n\n3. **Create 6 or 8 for Direct Multiplicative Pathways:**  \nGenerating 6 or 8 provides straightforward routes to 24. For example:  \n- To produce 6: combine 3 and 2 (`6 \u00f7 1 = 6`) or `7 - 1` if you can generate 1.  \n- To produce 8: combine 4 and 2 (`4 \u00d7 2 = 8`) or by adding/subtracting to reach these values.  \nFrom previous steps, if you can generate a 2 (e.g., `4 \u00f7 2 = 2`), multiplying by 4 yields 8, and then `8 \u00d7",

Moves that generate \"friendly\" numbers\u2014those that simplify subsequent calculations\u2014are prioritized. For instance, combining the two 3s to form 6 is advantageous because 6 \u00d7 4 readily yields 24, or dividing 12 by 3 results in 4, which can be combined with 6 to reach 24 efficiently.\n\nIn contrast, moves that produce awkward or non-strategic numbers, like 1 or 11, tend to complicate progress and should be avoided unless necessary. For example, creating a 1 often forces additional steps, increasing complexity and risk. Therefore, focusing on operations that yield multiples, factors, or sums close to common targets enhances efficiency.\n\nOperational legality is paramount: each number can only be used once, and no numbers should be dropped or reused improperly. Moves must respect the constraints, avoiding"

The key insight from recent analysis is that multiplying 3 and 5 to produce 15 is a valid and effective first step, as it correctly consumes these two numbers and leaves the set {1, 9, 15}. From this point, the goal is to combine the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\nAfter obtaining 15 and having 9 left, the best approach is to see if 15 and 9 can be combined to produce 24. Since 15 + 9 = 24, this directly solves the puzzle. The sequence is:\n\n1. Combine 3 and 5: **3 * 5 = 15** (set now {1, 9, 15})\n2. Add 9 and 15: **9 + 15 = 24**\n\nThis approach is straightforward, uses legal operations, and efficiently reaches the target.\n\nAlternatively, if the addition doesn't lead directly to 24, consider other combinations:\n\n- Use 1 with 9 or 15 to reach 24 indirectly, but these are less direct.\n- Remember that multiplication or division can be used to reach intermediate targets if addition isn't straightforward.\n\nThe essential refined strategy is:\n\n- Prioritize multiplying 3 and 5 to get 15.\n- Use addition to combine 9 and 15 to reach 24.\n-",

The most promising approach involves leveraging multiplication of 3 and 5 to produce 15, as it consumes both numbers in a single, productive step. From there, explore combining the remaining numbers (1 and 9) with 15 to reach 24.\n\nThe key refined strategy is:\n\n1. Multiply 3 and 5: **3 * 5 = 15**. This is a sure move and reduces the problem to {1, 9, 15}.\n2. Use addition to combine 9 and 15: **9 + 15 = 24**. This directly achieves the goal.\n\nThis sequence is both straightforward and legal. Alternatively, consider combining 1 and 9 to get 10, then adding or multiplying with 15, but these paths tend to be less direct or lead away from 24.\n\nThe recent analysis shows that attempting to subtract or divide 9 and 1 (e.g., 9 - 1 = ",

This is invalid unless 15 is explicitly constructed from the initial numbers before division. The correct approach involves first explicitly forming 15 from the initial numbers, then applying subsequent operations.\n\n2. **Form 15 efficiently by multiplying 3 and 5:**  \nMultiplying 3 and 5 yields 15 (3 * 5 = 15), which is a productive move because it consolidates two numbers into a single, larger value closer to 24. This step reduces the problem to manageable parts, leaving the numbers 1 and 9 unaltered.\n\n3. **Combine remaining numbers to reach 24:**  \nAfter obtaining 15, the remaining numbers are 1 and 9. The most straightforward way to reach 24 is to add 9 to 15:  \n15 + 9 = 24\n\nThis path is simple, uses only valid operations, and directly achieves the goal.\n\n**Proposed step-by-step solution:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Multiply 3 and 5:  \n  **3 * 5 = 15**  \n  Remaining numbers: 1, 9, and the new 15.\n\n- **Step 2:** Add 15 and 9:  \n  **15 + 9 = 24**  \n\nThis sequence is valid, efficient, and aligns with the refined strategy of forming intermediate multiples of the larger numbers and then combining them additively to reach 24.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- Attempting to subtract ",

Moves resulting in remaining sets like {3}, {5}, {9}, {15}, or {8} tend to be unpromising because these states either stagnate progress or are difficult to combine into 24. For the specific set 1, 3, 5, 9, initial operations should focus on combining numbers to produce intermediate targets that facilitate reaching 24, such as forming 15 or 9 through addition or multiplication, then combining these results efficiently. Moves that use numbers directly\u2014like 5 + 9 = 14 or 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\u2014are promising if they lead to simplified subsequent steps. Conversely"

Past attempts reveal that the most straightforward and reliable strategy involves creating a large intermediate value from two numbers and then combining it with the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\n**Key Actionable Insights:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining Small Numbers into Larger, Manageable Totals:**  \nMultiplying 3 and 5 yields 15 (3 * 5 = 15), which is a crucial step. This consolidates two numbers into a single, larger number closer to 24, simplifying subsequent calculations. Using multiplication here is optimal because it produces a larger intermediate value, reducing the complexity of reaching 24.\n\n2. **Use Addition to Reach 24 from the Large Intermediate:**  \nAfter obtaining 15, adding 9 results in 24 (15 + 9 = 24). This is the most direct route, leveraging the intermediate 15 and the remaining 9. The remaining number 1 can be ignored or used in other operations if needed, but since the goal is to reach 24, the addition of 15 and 9 suffices.\n\n3. **Construct the Solution Step-by-Step:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Multiply 3 and 5 to get 15:  \n     `3 * 5 = 15`  \n     Remaining numbers: 1, 9, and the newly formed 15.\n   \n   - **Step 2:** Add 15 and 9 to reach 24:  \n     `15 + 9 = 24`  \n     Remaining numbers: 1 (unused), but the goal has been achieved.\n\n4. **Validate the Sequence and Operations:**  \nThis sequence adheres strictly to game rules: each initial number is used exactly once, and only basic operations are employed. It is both efficient and transparent, avoiding convoluted steps that involve intermediate totals not explicitly formed from the initial numbers.\n\n5. **Addressing Alternative Approaches:**  \nAttempting to use subtraction or division to manipulate 1, 3, 5, and ",

                    "summary": "Refined Strategy for Solving the 24 Game with Numbers 1, 3, 5, and 9\n\nWhen approaching the 24 game with the specific set of numbers 1, 3, 5, and 9, it\u2019s crucial to focus on forming intermediate values that lead directly or indirectly to the target number 24, while strictly adhering to the rules: each number must be used exactly once, and only basic operations (+, \u2013, \u00d7, \u00f7) are permitted. The recent analysis reveals that understanding the sequence and legality of operations based on the evolving set of available numbers is fundamental. Here is a concise, targeted strategy integrating past learnings and new insights:\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining Numbers to Create Manageable Intermediate Values:**\n   - Multiplying 3 and 5 to produce 15 is highly effective because it consolidates two numbers into a larger, more versatile number. This step reduces complexity by decreasing the number of operands and creates a promising stepping stone toward 24.\n   - The operation: `3 * 5 = 15` is both legal and straightforward, forming an intermediate that is close to 24 when combined with the remaining numbers.\n\n2. **Use Addition to Reach 24 from the Large Intermediate:**\n   - Once 15 is obtained, adding 9 directly yields 24:\n     `15 + 9 = 24`\n   - This sequence leverages the large intermediate value to reach the goal efficiently.\n   - The remaining number, 1, can be ignored or used elsewhere if necessary, but since the goal is achieved at this step, the process can conclude here.\n\n3. **Sequence of Operations and Validity Checks:**\n   - **Step 1:** Multiply 3 and 5:\n     ```\n     3 * 5 = 15\n     ```\n     Remaining numbers: 1, 9, and 15 (the new value).\n   \n   - **Step 2:** Add 15 and 9:\n     ```\n     15 + 9 = 24\n     ```\n     The game is successfully solved here, with the remaining number 1 unused. This sequence strictly uses each initial number once and only employs permitted operations, fulfilling the rules.\n\n4. **Addressing Alternative Approaches and Their Legality:**\n   - Attempting other combinations, such as `(3 * 5) - 9 = 6`, is valid but less direct for reaching 24. While 6 is a useful intermediate, it doesn't directly solve the puzzle. It might be part of a longer chain, but for the simplest solution, the addition approach is superior.\n   - The attempt `(1 + 3) * 5 = 20` is invalid in this context because, after initial steps, the number 3 is no longer available in the current set of numbers, emphasizing the importance of operation legality based on the current set.\n\n5. **Key",

Moves producing sets such as {3}, {5}, {9}, {15}, or {8} tend to be unpromising because they either stagnate progress or complicate subsequent operations.

Critical insights include the importance of choosing operations that respect the current set of available numbers at each step and focusing on intermediate results that are close to or directly lead to 24.\n\n**Key Actionable Strategies:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining Larger, Complementary Numbers via Multiplication:**\n   - The pair `(3 * 5 = 15)` is particularly powerful because it transforms two numbers into a manageable intermediate that is close to 24.\n   - This operation reduces complexity and sets up a straightforward addition step.\n\n2. **Use Addition to Reach 24 from the Large Intermediate:**\n   - After obtaining 15, adding 9 yields exactly 24: `(15 + 9 = 24)`.\n   - This is the most direct and reliable pathway, utilizing the remaining numbers efficiently.\n   - The number 1 remains unused in this sequence, which is acceptable as the rules only specify using each number exactly once; unused numbers are permissible if the solution is valid.\n\n3. **Sequence of Operations for an Optimal Solution:**\n   \n   - **Step 1:** Multiply 3 and 5:\n     ```\n     3 * 5 = 15\n     ```\n     Remaining numbers: 1, 9, and 15 (the new intermediate).\n   \n   - **Step 2:** Add 15 and 9:\n     ```\n     15 + 9 = 24\n     ```\n     Remaining number: 1 (unused), solution achieved.\n   \n   This sequence is both valid and efficient, fulfilling all rules: each initial number used exactly once, only permitted operations (+, \u2013, \u00d7, \u00f7) are employed, and the target number 24 is reached.\n\n4. **Alternative Valid Pathways & Their Legality:**\n   - **Using different combinations:** For example, `(1 + 3) * 5 = 20`, then adding 4 (not available in this set), or subtracting and dividing in complex ways, tend to be less straightforward or invalid given the current set of numbers.\n   - **Avoiding illegal moves:** Any operation that attempts to use a number not present at the current step, or reuses a number, invalidates the solution. For example, trying to operate on 3 after it has been combined and replaced in previous steps is invalid.\n   \n5. **Understanding the Limitations of Other Approaches:**\n   - Attempts to reach 24 via combinations like `(3 + 5) + 9 = 17` or `(1 + 3) * 5 = 20` do not directly solve the puzzle but can serve as intermediate steps in longer chains if they lead closer to 24.\n   - The key is to recognize that multiplication of 3 and 5 to get 15, followed by addition of 9, is the most straightforward method given the initial set.\n\n6. **Addressing Past Mistakes & Ensuring Legality:**\n   - Avoid steps where the operation involves a number no longer available in the current set.\n   - For example, after the initial step `(1 * 3 = 3)`, the next operation should involve only the remaining numbers: 3, 5, 9",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 24 game for the set {1, 3, 5, 9}, a promising step is one that systematically reduces the complexity by forming intermediate totals aligned with strategic targets\u2014particularly sums like 15 or 9, or products that facilitate reaching 24 efficiently. Moves that produce remaining sets such as {3}, {5}, {9}, {15}, or {8} tend to be unpromising unless they directly lead towards these targets, as they often cause stagnation or increase difficulty in subsequent steps. Effective moves are those that combine numbers to create these key totals, thereby streamlining the path to 24. For example, multiplying 1 and 3 to get 3 is promising because it preserves options for forming 15 or 9 later. Conversely, moves that involve illegal reuse of values, such as reusing a number already used or dropping numbers improperly, significantly reduce the move\u2019s promise. This is confirmed by recent feedback indicating that only the original set {1, 3, 5, 9} and the subsequent set {3, 5, 9} after the initial move are valid states. Moves that deviate from these rules\u2014such as generating combinations involving values not present in the previous step"

Critical insights emphasize respecting the rules\u2014each number used exactly once\u2014and avoiding invalid operations such as creating or referencing results not present in the initial set.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Leverage Multiplication to Form Manageable Intermediates:**\n   The combination `(3 * 5 = 15)` is particularly powerful because it reduces two numbers into a value close to 24, setting up a straightforward addition with 9. Multiplying 3 and 5 simplifies the path toward 24, and is often the most direct step.\n\n2. **Utilize Addition with Remaining Numbers to Reach 24:**\n   After obtaining 15, adding 9 yields exactly 24: `(15 + 9 = 24)`. This sequence respects the rule of using each number once and is the most straightforward solution pathway.\n\n3. **Incorporate the Remaining Number (1) Strategically:**\n   The number 1 can be used or left unused if the equation is valid. For the most concise solution, leaving 1 unused is permissible, provided the operations use only the initial four numbers.\n\n4. **Avoid Invalid or Impossible Operations:**\n   - Do not attempt to perform operations resulting in or involving numbers not in the initial set.\n   - For example, **does not** attempt `24 / 1 = 24` because 24 is not part of the original set; such moves are invalid.\n   - Use only valid arithmetic operations (+, \u2013, \u00d7, \u00f7) on the current numbers.\n\n5. **Sequence of Operations for an Optimal Solution:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Multiply 3 and 5:\n     ```\n     3 * 5 = 15\n     ```\n     Remaining numbers: 1, 9, and 15 (intermediate).\n   \n   - **Step 2:** Add 15 and 9:\n     ```\n     15 + 9 = ",

The key is to prioritize combining larger numbers through multiplication to generate manageable intermediates, then use addition or subtraction to reach the target. Careful attention must be paid to the use of each number exactly once and avoiding operations that involve or produce results outside the initial set.\n\n**Core Principles and Updated Insights:**\n\n1. **Leverage Multiplication to Create Near-Target Intermediates:**  \n   Multiplying numbers like 3 and 5 yields 15, a valuable intermediate close to 24. Such operations reduce complexity and provide a straightforward path to the target. For example:\n   ```\n   3 * 5 = 15\n   ```\n   Remaining numbers: 1, 9, and 15.\n\n2. **Combine Intermediates with Remaining Numbers via Addition:**  \n   After obtaining 15, adding 9 yields exactly 24:\n   ```\n   15 + 9 = 24\n   ```\n   This sequence uses each number once and is both concise and valid.\n\n3. **Use the Remaining Number (1) Strategically:**  \n   The number 1 often remains unused in the simplest solutions, which is permissible if the operations on the other numbers suffice to produce 24. However, if utilizing 1 simplifies the solution, incorporate it via addition or subtraction, provided it doesn't violate the rules.\n\n4. **Respect the Rules of Operations and Usage:**  \n   - Each initial number must be used exactly once.\n   - Only perform valid operations (+, \u2013, \u00d7, \u00f7).\n   - Do not generate or reference intermediate results not directly derived from the initial set.\n\n5. **Avoid Invalid Moves and Reuse of Numbers:**  \n   An important recent learning is to prevent reusing numbers in a way that conflicts with previous steps. For example, if you create 15 by multiplying 3 and 5, do not reuse 3 or 5 in a subsequent step unless they are still available in the current set of remaining numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Practical Step-by-Step Solution Approach:\n\n**Step 1:**  \nIdentify the most productive multiplication:\n```\n3 * 5 = 15\n```\nRemaining numbers: 1, 9, and 15.\n\n**Step 2:**  \nAdd 15 and 9:\n```\n15 + 9 = 24\n```\nRemaining numbers: 1, 24 (but since 24 is the target, we are done).\n\n**Note:**  \nIn this sequence, the number 1 remains unused, which is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Pathways and Considerations:\n\n- **Using 1 in the calculation:**  \n  Sometimes, including 1 simplifies the path. For example:\n  ```\n  9 - 1 = 8\n  ```\n  then combining with other operations to reach 24.\n\n- **Combining 1 differently:**  \n  For example:\n  ```\n  (3 + 5) * (9 - 1) = 8 * 8 = 64 (too high",

Recent attempts highlight the importance of avoiding invalid steps that introduce non-original numbers, such as 24, and reinforce the value of strategic multiplication and addition.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Leverage Multiplication to Generate Near-Target Intermediates:**\n   Combining larger numbers early is crucial. Multiplying 3 and 5 yields 15, which is close to 24, simplifying subsequent steps. This approach minimizes complexity and reduces the number of operations needed to reach the target.\n\n2. **Use Remaining Numbers to Adjust the Total:**\n   After establishing a strong intermediate like 15, adding or subtracting the remaining numbers (notably 9 and 1) should aim to reach 24 with minimal steps. For example, adding 9 to 15 directly yields 24, which is optimal.\n\n3. **Respect the Use of All Original Numbers Exactly Once:**\n   Every step must only involve the initial set: 1, 3, 5, and 9. No intermediate or external numbers (like 24) are permitted. This prevents invalid moves that violate game rules.\n\n4. **Incorporate the Number 1 Strategically:**\n   The number 1 can fine-tune totals via addition, subtraction, or multiplication. Use it only when it simplifies the path, such as multiplying by 1 to preserve a total or adding 1 to a sum for precise adjustment.\n\n5. **Avoid Invalid Operations and Reuse:**\n   Do not reuse results or perform operations that produce numbers outside the original set unless explicitly justified by the problem context. For example, creating 24 directly from 24 * 1 is invalid",

Specifically, multiplying 3 and 5 to get 15 is a strong starting point, as it simplifies subsequent steps toward 24.\n\nKey actionable strategies:\n\n1. **Prioritize Multiplication of 3 and 5:**  \n   Multiplying these yields 15, a near-miss to 24 that sets up straightforward addition with remaining numbers. This step is valid and uses only original numbers, aligning with the rule of each number being used exactly once.\n\n2. **Use 9 and 1 for Adjustment:**  \n   After obtaining 15, adding 9 directly gives 24 (15 + 9 = 24). This is the most direct route, requiring minimal operations. The number 1 can be incorporated if needed to fine-tune totals, but in this case, it's unnecessary since 15 + 9 achieves 24 immediately.\n\n3. **Avoid Invalid Operations and Reuses:**  \n   Do not perform operations that produce numbers outside the original set unless justified by the rules. For example, creating 24 by multiplying 24 * 1 is invalid because 24 is not one of the initial numbers.\n\n4. **Strategic Use of 1:**  \n   Use 1 to adjust totals only when it simplifies the calculation. For instance, multiplying by 1 preserves a total or adding 1 to adjust a sum",
                    "value_summary": "For the 24 Game with numbers 1, 3, 5, and 9, effective move evaluation hinges on how well a step advances toward the target total of 24 by creating advantageous intermediate values. Valid moves are those that produce intermediate totals closely aligned with key benchmarks\u2014such as 12, 15, or 9\u2014that facilitate straightforward combinations to reach 24. For example, multiplying 3 and 5 to produce 15 opens a direct pathway, or combining 9 with 1 to retain 9 maintains a useful building block. Moves that generate values inconsistent with current available numbers or that reintroduce previously used results illegitimately are invalid and should be deemed impossible. Each move must strictly use the current set of numbers without reusing or reintroducing past results, ensuring logical progression. Moves producing intermediate totals that are too far removed from 24 or that do not simplify the remaining calculation are less promising."

Specifically, multiplying 3 and 5 to get 15 remains a strong starting point, as it simplifies subsequent steps toward 24. From 15, adding 9 directly yields 24 (15 + 9 = 24), which is the most straightforward path with minimal operations.\n\nThe previous summary highlights this core tactic: prioritize multiplying 3 and 5, then add 9 for quick results. The number 1 can be useful for fine adjustments, such as adding or subtracting 1 to reach the exact total if needed, but it\u2019s not necessary in the simplest solution.\n\nRecent attempts reveal the importance of carefully selecting operations to avoid illegal or impossible moves. For example, combining 3 + 1 to get 4 is valid; however, subsequent steps must be performed with remaining numbers without reusing or creating invalid intermediate values. The previous attempt's error\u2014performing an illegal Step 3\u2014illustrates that operations must strictly involve only the remaining original numbers, each used exactly once, and produce only permissible intermediate results.\n\nTo refine the strategy:\n\n1. **Start with multiplication of 3 and 5:**  \n   - 3 \u00d7 5 = 15  \n   - Remaining numbers: 1, 9\n\n2. **Use 9 and 15 to reach 24:**  \n   - 15 + 9 = 24  \n   - If needed, incorporate 1 for adjustments, but in this case, it's unnecessary.\n\n3. **Use 1 for fine-tuning only if direct operations don\u2019t yield 24:**  \n   - For example, if you get 23 or 25, adding or subtracting 1 adjusts to 24.\n\n4. **Avoid invalid operations",

Effective moves are those that produce intermediate totals aligning with key benchmarks\u2014such as 12, 15, or 9\u2014that facilitate straightforward combinations to reach 24. For instance, combining 3 and 5 to produce 15 creates a promising pathway, as 15 can combine with 9 or 1 through addition or multiplication to approach 24 efficiently. Similarly, operations like 9 + 1 = 10 or 9 - 3 = 6 are less directly useful but can be combined later to reach the target.\n\nMoves that generate values incompatible with remaining numbers or that fail to simplify the calculation are less promising. Producing totals far from 24 (e.g., 4 or 6 without a clear subsequent step) tend to be less effective unless they set up a direct route to 24.

The combination 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 is especially effective because it yields a manageable number that is just 9 less than 24, enabling a straightforward addition.\n\n2. **Use Remaining Numbers to Reach 24 Efficiently:**  \n   Once you\u2019ve established 15, the remaining numbers are 1 and 9. The next goal is to incorporate these to reach 24. Direct addition: 15 + 9 = 24, is the most straightforward move, involving only one addition operation and utilizing the leftover 9 directly.\n\n3. **Avoid Unnecessary or Illegal Operations:**  \n   After using 3 and 5 in the initial multiplication, only 1 and 9 remain. Any attempt to combine these must be valid within the rules:\n\n   - You cannot reuse numbers.\n   - You cannot create intermediate results that do not correspond to the remaining numbers.\n   - Operations must be performed with only the current leftover numbers.\n\n4. **Fine-Tuning with 1:**  \n   The number 1 is useful for adjustments if the total falls short or overshoots.

The recent attempt highlights critical insights into what constitutes promising versus unpromising steps, especially regarding the legality and utility of intermediate values.\n\n**Key Principles for Effective Moves:**\n\n1. **Strict adherence to move legality:**  \n   Each operation must involve exactly two numbers selected from the current set. The result of this operation then replaces those two numbers, maintaining the total number of elements in the set until only one remains. No numbers can be reused or dropped arbitrarily, and no intermediate results can be introduced without proper derivation from the current set.\n\n2. **Progression toward reachable benchmarks:**  \n   Moves should aim to produce intermediate values that simplify subsequent steps. Values close to or divisible into 24\u2014such as 12, 15, or 9\u2014are particularly advantageous, as they facilitate straightforward combinations to reach the target. For example, creating 15 by combining 3 and 5 is promising because 15 can combine with 9 or 1 via addition or multiplication to approach 24 efficiently.\n\n3. **Avoidance of invalid intermediate states:**  \n   Generating intermediate totals that do not logically follow from available numbers or that require reusing or dropping numbers violates the rules. For example, performing 3 * 5 = 15 and then claiming the set is {1, 9} is invalid because the operation used 3 and 5, which should be replaced by 15, leading to the set {1, 9, 15}. Any attempt that drops numbers or uses previous results improperly is unpromising and invalid.\n\n4. **Value of intermediate totals:**  \n   Producing totals that are incompatible with remaining numbers or that do not help to progress toward 24 indicates unpromising moves.

The most effective approach involves identifying high-impact multiplications early, then using the remaining numbers to reach 24 with minimal steps, ensuring each number is used exactly once.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Multiplying Large Numbers to Reach or Near 24:**  \n   Since 9 is the largest, consider pairing it with other numbers to generate intermediate totals close to 24. Multiplying 9 by 3 yields 27, which is just 3 over 24, providing a straightforward adjustment. Alternatively, multiplying 3 and 5 yields 15, which pairs well with 9 or 1 to quickly reach 24.\n\n2. **Use Addition or Subtraction to Fine-Tune Totals:**  \n   Once a near-target number like 15 or 27 is achieved, combine it with the remaining number(s) to reach 24. For example, adding 9 to 15 gives 24, or subtracting 3 from 27 yields 24. This approach minimizes the number of operations and reduces complexity.\n\n3. **Respect the Rules of the Game:**  \n   - Use each number exactly once.  \n   - Only perform permissible operations (+, \u2013, \u00d7, \u00f7).  \n   - Do not reuse intermediate results or ignore remaining numbers.  \n   - Any intermediate calculation must involve unused numbers at that step.\n\n4. **Utilize the '1' for Adjustments Only When Necessary:**  \n   The number 1 is particularly useful for fine-tuning totals, such as converting 23 to 24 by adding 1, or adjusting overshoots. If the primary calculation already yields 24, 1 can be left unused.\n\n**Specific Solution Path:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Multiply 3 and",

Based on recent insights, the evaluation model emphasizes the following principles:\n\n1. **Legal Operation Compliance:**  \n   Every move must involve exactly two numbers from the current set. The operation's result replaces those two numbers, preserving the set's size until only one number remains. No reuse, dropping, or arbitrarily introducing new numbers or intermediate values outside the current set is permitted. Moves like multiplying 9 and 3 to get 27 are valid only if 9 and 3 are present and used once; subsequent steps must correctly incorporate the new total without violating rules.\n\n2. **Progression Toward Simplification and Reachability:**  \n   Moves should aim to produce intermediate totals that facilitate reaching 24. Values close to or divisibly related to 24\u2014such as 12, 15, or 9\u2014are particularly promising. For instance, combining 3 and 5 to obtain 15 provides a flexible stepping stone, as 15 can combine with 9 or 1 in subsequent steps to approach 24 efficiently.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Invalid Intermediate States:**  \n   Generating totals that cannot logically arise from the current set indicates unpromising moves. For example, creating 27 from 9 * 3 is valid, but subsequent steps must incorporate this 27 correctly, replacing"

Alternatively, multiplying 3 and 5 produces 15, which can be combined with 9 or 1 to approach 24.\n\n2. **Use Addition or Subtraction for Fine-Tuning:**  \n   Once an intermediate number close to 24 is obtained, employ addition or subtraction with the remaining numbers to reach exactly 24. For example, if you have 27, subtracting 3 (if available) gives 24. When working with 15, adding 9 yields 24. The key is to sequence operations so that each step logically brings you closer to the target with minimal complexity.\n\n3. **Leverage the \u20181\u2019 for Precise Adjustments:**  \n   The number 1 is particularly useful for minor adjustments, such as adding 1 to reach 24 from 23, or subtracting 1 from 25, when the main calculations are close to the target. Use 1 only when necessary, to avoid complicating the process.\n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary Operations and Reuse:**  \n   Each number must be used exactly once, and intermediate results should be based solely on these unused numbers at each step. Keep the order of operations clear and simple, avoiding complex or nested calculations that introduce errors or invalid steps.\n\n---\n\n**Practical Application with the Given Numbers (1, 3, 5, 9):**\n\n**Step 1:** Multiply 9 by 3:  \n- 9 \u00d7 3 = 27  \nRemaining numbers: 1, 5\n\n",

Past attempts reveal that leveraging multiplication of larger numbers early, followed by precise additions or subtractions, simplifies reaching the target. Here, we synthesize prior learnings and recent insights to craft a concise, effective strategy tailored to these four numbers.\n\n**Core Principles for the 1, 3, 5, 9 Puzzle**\n\n1. **Prioritize Multiplication of Large Numbers for Significant Gains:**  \n   The numbers 9 and 5 are the largest, so multiplying them often yields a result close to 45, which can be adjusted down to 24 with minimal operations. Alternatively, multiplying 9 by 3 gives 27, a near target\u2014only one away from 24\u2014making it a promising starting point.\n\n2. **Use the Largest Numbers First to Reach or Approach 24:**  \n   The goal is to generate an intermediate value close to 24, ideally exactly 24, using a combination of the high-impact operations. For example, multiplying 9 by 3 yields 27, which is just one over 24. This small difference suggests that subtracting 3 or adding/subtracting the remaining numbers can lead directly to the target.\n\n3. **Leverage the Remaining Numbers for Fine Adjustments:**  \n   Once an approximate value is obtained, use addition or subtraction with the leftover numbers (1 and 5) to reach 24 precisely. The number 1 is especially useful for minor adjustments, such as subtracting 1 from 25 to reach 24 or adding 1 to 23.\n\n4. **Avoid Unnecessary or Illegal Operations:**  \n   Each number must be used exactly once, and operations must be valid and conform to the game's rules. Combining numbers in invalid ways or reusing numbers leads to dead ends or invalid solutions.\n\n5. **Use the Number 1 Judiciously for Minor Corrections:**  \n   The 1 is valuable for fine-tuning. For example, if you reach 23 or 25, adding or subtracting 1 gets you to 24 efficiently.\n\n**Applying These Principles to the Numbers 1, 3, 5, and 9**\n\nGiven the numbers, the most promising initial steps are:\n\n- Multiply 9 by 3:  \n  9 \u00d7 3 = 27  \n  Remaining numbers: 1 and 5\n\n- Alternatively, multiply 5 by 3:  \n  5 \u00d7 3 = 15  \n  Remaining numbers: 1 and 9\n\n- Or multiply 9 by 5:  \n  9 \u00d7 5 = 45  \n  Remaining numbers: 1 and 3\n\nBut focusing on the first: **9 \u00d7 3 = 27**, because it\u2019s close to 24, only one over.\n\n**From 27, use the remaining numbers (1 and 5) to reach 24:**\n\n- Subtract 1 from 27:  \n  27 - 1 = 26, which is just one over 24.  \n\n- Now, subtract the",

Producing totals like 12, 15, or 9 is advantageous because these values serve as effective stepping stones toward 24. For example, combining 3 and 5 to produce 15 is promising, as it provides a flexible pathway\u2014pairing 15 with 9 or 1 can lead to 24 via straightforward operations (e.g., 15 + 9 = 24).

This is a highly promising starting point because it minimizes the adjustments needed. Similarly, multiplying 5 by 3 yields 15, which is further from 24 and less advantageous as an initial move. Multiplying 9 by 5 yields 45, which is too large; subsequent reductions become more complex.  \n   \n2. **Use the Largest Numbers First to Generate a Close Intermediate**  \n   Starting with `9 * 3 = 27` utilizes the largest available numbers to produce a result close to 24. Since 27 exceeds 24 by only 1, the goal becomes adjusting 27 downward by 1 to reach 24, ideally using the remaining numbers.\n\n3. **Utilize Remaining Numbers for Fine-Tuning**  \n   After obtaining 27, the remaining numbers are 1 and 5. The most straightforward adjustment is subtracting 1 from 27 to achieve 26, then subtracting 2 or 1 again to reach 24. However, since only 5 and 1 are available, and direct subtraction of 5 or 1 from 27 gives 22 or 26, respectively, we need to consider the best sequence.  \n   \n   For example, from 27:  \n   - Subtract 1: `27 - 1 = 26`  \n   - Then subtract 5: `26 - 5 = 21` (too low)  \n   \n   Alternatively, from 27, subtract 3 (not available), or combine operations differently. But with only 1 and 5 left, the best adjustment is to subtract 1 or 5 directly from the total.\n\n4. **Avoid Invalid or Illegal Operations**  \n   Each number must be used exactly once, and operations must be valid. Combining numbers in a way that reuses or exceeds the rules invalidates the solution.\n\n5. **Leverage the Number 1 for Precise Adjustments**  \n   The singleton `1` is particularly useful for small corrections. If the intermediate step yields ",
                    "value_summary": "Refined Evaluation Model for the 24 Game with Numbers 1, 3, 5, and 9\n\nEffective moves are those that strategically produce intermediate totals serving as reliable stepping stones toward 24. When selecting two numbers and an operation, prioritize results like 12, 15, or 9, which facilitate straightforward pathways to 24 through simple addition or multiplication. For example, combining 3 and 5 to get 15 offers a promising route: adding 9 to 15 yields 24, while pairing 15 with 1 can also lead to 24 via division or subtraction. Similarly, creating 12 through (3 + 9) or (5 + 7) opens alternative solutions. These intermediate values are advantageous because they reduce complexity and increase the likelihood of reaching 24 with subsequent operations.\n\nConversely, generating totals such as 27 (via 9 * 3) may seem promising but often lead to dead ends if subsequent steps cannot efficiently reach 24. Moves resulting in totals that are either too large, too small, or not directly related to 24 should be scrutinized carefully; they tend to be less promising unless they can be combined with other numbers to produce key intermediates.\n\nIllegal moves\u2014such as reusing numbers beyond their availability or performing invalid operations\u2014must"

Drawing from past attempts and accumulated insights, the key to efficiently reaching 24 involves prioritizing high-impact operations, leveraging the unique properties of the numbers, and minimizing unnecessary complexity.\n\n**1. Prioritize Multiplication of the Largest Numbers First**\n\nThe numbers 9 and 3 are particularly conducive to producing intermediate results close to 24. Multiplying 9 by 3 yields 27, which is just one over 24. This proximity makes it an optimal initial move because it reduces the adjustments needed to reach the target. Starting with:\n\n- **9 * 3 = 27**\n\nthen adjusting downward with the remaining numbers (1 and 5) is often more straightforward than other approaches. This initial step effectively uses the largest numbers to generate a near-target intermediate.\n\n**2. Use the Remaining Numbers for Fine-Tuning**\n\nAfter obtaining 27, the goal becomes adjusting this value to exactly 24. Since we have 1 and 5 left, the options include addition, subtraction, or division. The simplest method is to subtract 1 from 27:\n\n- **27 - 1 = 26**\n\nwhich is just one above 24. To reach 24, subtracting 2 would be ideal, but since 2 isn't directly available, we need to explore combining the remaining numbers differently.\n\nAlternatively, consider:\n\n- Using 5 to subtract from 27:\n\n  **27 - 5 = 22**\n\nwhich is below 24, but perhaps easier to adjust upward with the remaining operations.\n\n**3. Exploit the Number 1 for Precise Adjustments**\n\nThe number 1 is invaluable for small, precise adjustments. For example:\n\n- After obtaining 27, subtract 1 to get 26, then subtract 2 (which can be formed as 5 - 3) to reach 24:\n\n  **26 - (5 - 3) = 26 - 2 = 24**\n\nThis approach involves creating 2 by subtracting 3 from 5, which is straightforward. The sequence would be:\n\n- 9 * 3 = 27\n\n- 5 - 3 = 2\n\n- 27 - 1 - (5 - 3) = 24\n\nAlternatively, combine these operations directly:\n\n- **(9 * 3) - (5 - 3) - 1 = 24**\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n- 27 - 2 - 1 = 24\n\n**4.",

Producing totals like 25 (e.g., from 5 * 5 if available) or 4 (from 5 - 1) may require more complex manipulations, reducing their desirability unless they set up straightforward final steps.\n\nMoves that lead to totals incompatible"

Past attempts and learnings reveal several effective tactics to efficiently reach 24, notably emphasizing the strategic use of high-value operations early, judicious use of small adjustments, and ensuring operation legality.\n\n**Key Strategic Principles:**\n\n1. **Prioritize High-Impact Multiplications with Large Numbers**  \nBegin by exploiting the largest numbers to generate intermediate results close to 24. Multiplying 9 by 3 yields 27, which is just one over 24 and offers a straightforward path to fine-tuning. This approach reduces complexity because adjusting from 27 down to 24 is simpler than building up from smaller numbers. For example:\n\n- **9 * 3 = 27**\n\nOnce you have 27, the goal is to subtract or adjust to reach 24 with the remaining numbers.\n\n2. **Use Remaining Numbers for Precise Adjustments**  \nAfter creating a near-target intermediate like 27, utilize the leftover numbers\u20141 and 5\u2014to fine-tune the total. Since 27 is just one above 24, subtracting 1 achieves the target:\n\n- **27 - 1 = 26**, which is close but overshoots by 2.\n\nAlternatively, if subtracting 5:\n\n- **27 - 5 = 22**, below 24.\n\nGiven these, the more precise adjustment is to generate a small number like 2 or 3 for subtraction or addition.\n\n3. **Generate Small Numbers (like 2 or 3) Using the Remaining Numbers**  \nThe number 1 is invaluable for small adjustments. To create 2, subtract 3 from 5:\n\n- **5 - 3 = 2**\n\nThis allows you to fine-tune the total effectively. For instance, from 27:\n\n- **27 - 2 = 25**, still close but slightly over.\n\nAlternatively, from the initial multiplication:\n\n- **(9 * 3) = 27**\n\nand then subtract **(5 - 3) = 2** to get:\n\n- **(9 * 3) - (5 - 3) = 27 - 2 = 25**\n\nwhich is close but not exact. To reach 24, consider other operations.\n\n4. **Leverage the Small Number 1 for Exact Adjustments**  \nThe number 1 can be used to create 2 or ",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 24 Game with Numbers 1, 3, 5, and 9\n\nThis refined model emphasizes the strategic significance of generating intermediate totals aligned with common pathways toward 24, while minimizing dead-end results. Effective moves are those that produce manageable, familiar totals such as 12, 15, 18, or 9, which facilitate straightforward calculations to reach 24. For instance, combining 3 and 5 to produce 15 opens direct routes: adding 9 yields 24, or pairing 15 with 1 through subtraction or division can lead to the goal. Similarly, creating 12 via (3 + 9) offers a simplified pathway, reducing complexity and increasing success probability.\n\nMoves that generate these key intermediates tend to be promising because they align with known solution pathways and allow for efficient completion. For example, producing 9 directly from 9 or through operations like (3 * 3) (if possible) can help set up final steps. In contrast, totals that are too large or too small\u2014such as 25 or 4\u2014often require more convoluted manipulations, making subsequent steps less predictable and more prone to dead ends unless they set up straightforward final calculations.\n\nConversely, totals that are incompatible with reaching 24 directly\u2014either because they are too distant from 24 or because they do not facilitate simple combinations\u2014should be approached with caution. For example, achieving 27 via (9 * 3) might seem promising but often leads to complex or impossible subsequent steps. Similarly, totals like 25 or 4 may require extra operations that complicate the solution process.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s crucial to avoid moves that reuse numbers improperly or produce illegal"

Past attempts reveal key insights:\n\n1. **Prioritize straightforward operations:** Combining larger numbers early can simplify calculations. For example, multiplying 6 and 3 yields 18, bringing the target closer, then adding or subtracting the remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\n2. **Use division carefully:** When dividing, ensure it results in an integer and that the operation adheres to the rules\u2014no reusing or dropping numbers improperly. For instance, dividing 6 by 3 to get 2 is valid, but subsequent steps must handle the remaining numbers correctly.\n\n3. **Build from known combinations:** Recognize that 6 * 4 = 24, but since 4 isn't in the set, look for ways to generate 4 using available numbers\u2014such as 3 + 1 or 2 * 2\u2014but these are limited here. Alternatively, 3 * 2 = 6, which allows combining with remaining 9 to reach 24 via multiplication and addition.\n\n4. **Combine operations strategically:** For example, multiply 3 and 6 to get 18, then add 6 if available, or find ways to generate 6 from other operations to reach 24.\n\n5. **Avoid invalid steps",

Since 2, 3, 6, and 9 are the only numbers, any intermediate values must be derived through legitimate operations without reusing or inventing numbers outside the set.\n\n1. **Prioritize Multiplication of Larger Numbers:**  \nCombine 6 and 4 if possible, but since 4 isn't available, look for alternative ways to generate it. Notably, multiplying 3 by 2 yields 6, which is already in the set, allowing for straightforward multiples. For example, multiplying 3 and 2 gives 6, which can then be combined with other numbers for 24.\n\n2. **Leverage the 9 for Efficient Multiplication:**  \nMultiplying 9 by 2 yields 18, closer to 24. Adding the remaining 6 or 3 can help reach 24, but only if the operations respect the rules and the numbers are used exactly once.\n\n3. **Avoid Invalid or Impossible Steps:**  \nAny step that attempts to create a number not derivable from the initial set through legitimate operations is invalid. For example, creating 12 directly from 2 and 3 (via multiplication) is invalid unless explicitly derived (e.g., 2 * 6 = 12).  \nSimilarly, operations like 2 * 12 are invalid because 12 isn't in the original set or properly derived.\n\n4. **Construct 24 via Valid Operations:**  \nLook for",

The key is to leverage the relationships between these numbers through multiplication and addition, as these are the most straightforward routes to 24.\n\n**Prioritize Multiplication of Larger, Compatible Pairs:**  \nMultiplying 6 by 4 would be ideal, but 4 isn't in the set. Instead, recognize that 6 and 2 can produce 12 (via 6 * 2), which is a critical intermediate step. Similarly, multiplying 3 and 2 yields 6, which is already in the set, allowing for efficient use of numbers without creating extraneous values.\n\n**Use 9 for Near-Target Multiplications:**  \nMultiplying 9 by 2 yields 18, a close step toward 24. Combining this with the remaining numbers can then produce 24, but only if the operations are valid and the numbers are used exactly once. For example, if you have 18 and 6, adding them gives 24\u2014so a sequence like 9 * 2 = 18, then 18 + 6 = 24, is valid if the steps respect the rules.\n\n**Construct 24 via Valid, Stepwise Combinations:**  \nA concrete, valid solution is:  \n- Step 1: 6 * 4 = 24 \u2014 but since 4 isn\u2019t in the set, this is invalid directly.  \n- Instead, recognize that 6 *",

Prioritize combining larger compatible pairs\u2014particularly multiplication\u2014since they most directly approach 24. Avoid any steps involving non-existent intermediate numbers; for example, creating 4 from 2 and 3 is invalid unless explicitly possible within the rules.\n\nKey insights:\n\n1. **Leverage Multiplication of Larger Numbers:**  \n   Combining 6 and 4 would be ideal, but 4 is not given. Instead, use 6 * 2 = 12 as an intermediate step, which is valid and moves toward 24 when combined appropriately.\n\n2. **Use 9 for Near-Target Multiplications:**  \n   Multiplying 9 by 2 yields 18. Combining this with 6 or 3 can help reach 24, but only if the intermediate steps are valid and all original numbers are used exactly once.\n\n3. **Avoid Invalid Operations:**  \n   The prior attempt incorrectly used 6 * 4, which is invalid because 4 is not in the initial set. To prevent dead ends, verify each operation's validity before proceeding.\n\n4. **Construct 24 via Valid Stepwise Combinations:**  \n   For example, consider the sequence:  \n   - 3 * 2 = 6 (valid,",

Moves that combine numbers to produce sums, differences, or products aligning with reachable targets are promising. Specifically, avoid steps that leave 2 and 9 together unless they can combine into 18 or 18-related values, as certain combinations can be unproductive. Illegal steps\u2014such as using nonexistent numbers or creating invalid subsets\u2014should be immediately discarded. Prioritize operations that generate intermediate"

Use 6 * 2 = 12 early, then combine with remaining numbers to reach 24. \n\nAvoid starting with 9 * 2, as this yields 18, which, when combined with remaining numbers (3 and 6), does not straightforwardly produce 24\u2014e.g., 18 + 6 = 24 is invalid because 18 + 6 exceeds 24, and subtraction would require revisiting previous steps.

For example, multiplying 6 and 4 (if created) or adding smaller numbers to approach 24 are favorable strategies. Conversely, moves that lead to intermediate values impossible to reconcile with the remaining numbers\u2014such as results that cannot combine to total 24\u2014are unpromising. It is crucial to avoid configurations that generate residual values or intermediate results that do not facilitate further progress, as these represent dead ends. When evaluating a move, check whether the resulting intermediate value is logically reachable from the current set of numbers and whether it can contribute to reaching 24 through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division with the leftovers. Moves that logically utilize available numbers\u2014like combining 6 and 2 to make 12, then using 3 and 9 to"

Several effective pathways emerge once you recognize key relationships among these numbers.\n\nFirst, identify pairs that can combine to produce 12, since 12 \u00d7 2 = 24. The most straightforward way is to multiply 6 by 2:\n\n- **Step 1:** 6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n\nNow, to reach 24, multiply this 12 by 2 once more, but since 2 has already been used, you need to create a new 2 from remaining numbers or find alternative routes.\n\nAlternatively, consider the pairings involving 9 and 3:\n\n- **Step 1:** 9 - 3 = 6\n\nThis reduces 9 and 3 to a 6, which aligns with the existing 6, but using the same number twice in the same step is invalid. Instead, after obtaining 6 from 9 - 3, you can use the other 2 to multiply by 6:\n\n- **Step 2:** 6 \u00d7 2 = 12\n\nThen multiply by 2 again (which you need to generate), or find a way to double the 12 to 24, but since you only have one 2, the focus shifts to creating a 2 again or finding alternative operations.\n\nAnother promising route involves combining 3 and 2:\n\n- **Step 1:** 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n\nNow, with two 6s (from direct multiplication and the other 6), you can multiply:\n\n- **Step 2:** 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, but since 4 isn't in the set, this is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the key is to create 4 from available numbers:\n\n- 3 + 2 = 5 (",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 2, 3, 6, 9 puzzle, it\u2019s essential to distinguish between promising and unpromising steps based on their ability to lead toward 24. Promising moves generate intermediate values that can logically combine with remaining numbers to reach 24, typically by producing multiples or sums that facilitate further operations\u2014such as 8, 12, or 4\u2014especially when these values are divisible or can be combined with leftover numbers. For example, creating a 12 or an 8 often opens pathways to reach 24 through straightforward additions or multiplications. Conversely, moves resulting in values like 6 and 12 simultaneously tend to be dead ends, as combining these specific results does not yield 24 and often leaves the remaining numbers uncooperative. Additionally, any move that introduces invalid elements\u2014such as using numbers not present in the initial set (e.g., 4 when only 2, 3, 6, 9 are available)\u2014should be immediately deemed invalid and unpromising.

Key insights include:\n\n1. **Generate 6 or 12 Early:**  \n   - Combining 3 and 2 yields 6 (`3 \u00d7 2 = 6`), which can serve as a foundational element for reaching 24.  \n   - Combining 9 and 3 yields 6 (`9 - 3 = 6`), providing an alternative pathway to obtain 6 without using the 2 initially.\n\n2. **Use Multiplication to Reach 12:**  \n   - Multiply 6 by 2 (`6 \u00d7 2 = 12`) to reach 12, a critical stepping stone.  \n   - Remember that creating 12 allows you to multiply by 2 to reach 24, provided you have the necessary numbers.\n\n3. **Avoid Reusing Numbers Illegally:**  \n   - Each number can only be used once per calculation; plan operations accordingly to prevent reuse errors.  \n   - For example, after using 6 and 2 to make 12, you cannot reuse 2 unless you recreate it via other operations.\n\n4. **Construct 2 or 4 as Needed:**  \n   - If direct multiplication isn't straightforward, create 2 or 4 by combining the available numbers (`3 - 1` is invalid here, but `3 - 1` isn't possible; instead, consider combining 3 and 2 to",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 2, 3, 6, 9 puzzle, the core principle is to identify steps that generate intermediate results conducive to reaching 24. Promising moves produce values that align with the factors or multiples of 24\u2014such as 8, 12, or 4\u2014by combining remaining numbers through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. For example, creating 12 (via 6\u00d72) or 8 (via 3\u00d7(2+1)) can open straightforward pathways toward 24. Conversely, moves that produce results like 6 and 12 simultaneously tend to be dead ends; their combination typically does not yield 24, especially if they are the only remaining values. It is crucial that each step only involves numbers from the original set or results derived legitimately from prior operations; introducing invalid values\u2014such as 4 if it was not produced from the initial numbers\u2014is impermissible. Moves that rely on non-existent or incorrectly derived numbers are unpromising and should be discarded. Additionally, steps that produce results outside the scope of achievable combinations\u2014such as using values not obtainable from the original set"

Valid steps combine original numbers through legitimate operations, producing these helpful intermediates without violating the set's integrity. Moves resulting in values unrelated to these key factors often lead to dead-ends, as they do not support efficient completion or may produce invalid states. Crucially, after each move, the remaining numbers should always be original numbers or valid intermediate results obtained from prior steps. If an operation yields a number not derivable from the initial set, it indicates an invalid move, making subsequent steps impossible. Therefore, promising moves"

From 9 and 3, you can divide 9 \u00f7 3 = 3, then multiply by 2 to get 6 again. Alternatively, subtract 2 from 6 to obtain 4, then multiply 4 \u00d7 6 = 24.

Strict Adherence to Original Numbers and Usage Rules\n\n- Only use the numbers 2, 3, 6, and 9 exactly once each.\n- Operations are addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7).\n- Do not introduce new numbers or intermediate values that are not derived from the original set.\n- After each operation, update the list of remaining numbers accordingly, ensuring no reuse or reuse beyond initial count.\n\n2. Focused Use of Key Intermediate Targets: 12, 8, and 4\n\n- Recognize that certain intermediate values serve as effective stepping stones toward 24.\n- Notably:\n  - 12: can be formed via 6 \u00d7 2 or 3 \u00d7 4 (if 4 is created from other operations).\n  - 8: can be obtained through 6 \u2212 2 = 4, then multiply by 2 or 3.\n  - 4: from 6 \u2212 2, or 9 \u2212 5 (if 5 is created), but since 5 isn't available, focus on 6 \u2212 2.\n- Use these intermediates to multiply or combine toward 24.\n\n3. Exploit Division for Simplification and Precise Targets\n\n- Dividing larger numbers can produce smaller, more manageable intermediates.\n- For example:\n  - 9 \u00f7 3 = 3, which is directly useful.\n  - 6 \u00f7 3 = 2, also useful.\n- These divisions help create repeated factors or simplify the path to 24.\n\n4. Key Valid Pathways Based on the Original Set\n\n- The classic solution leveraging the available numbers:\n\n**Solution:**\n(3 - 2/6) \u00d7 9\n\n**Step-by-step:**\n- 2 \u00f7 6 = 1/3\n- 3 \u2212 1/3 = 8/3\n- (8/3) \u00d7 9 = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24\n\n**Operation details:**\n- Use 2 and 6 to form 1/3.\n- Subtract from 3 to get 8/3.\n- Multiply by 9 to reach 24.\n\n**Usage of numbers:**\n- 2, 3, 6, 9 are all used exactly once.\n- No intermediate values outside the initial set are introduced.\n- All steps involve only the original numbers and valid operations.\n\n5. Alternative Valid Strategies\n\n- Combining 6 and 3:\n  - 6 \u00f7 3 = 2\n- Using this with 9 and remaining 2:\n  - 9 \u00d7 2 = 18\n  - 18 + 6 (already",

Valid moves must involve only the original numbers or values derived strictly through permitted operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) without assuming or creating intermediate values that are not obtainable from the initial set. Moves that attempt to generate numbers like 5 or 4 without explicit derivation are invalid. \n\nFurthermore, moves that reduce the current set to numbers closer to 24 are promising, especially if they avoid introducing impossible or undefined intermediate steps. For example, combining 8 and 11 to get 88 or 10 and 1 to get 10 are less promising"

A key approach is to consider combining 10 and 11 directly, since their sum is 21, which is close to 24. From there, adding 1 yields 22, still just 2 short of 24. To bridge this gap, multiply 8 by 3 (which can be formed by 1 + 2), but since 2 isn't directly available, consider alternative methods. Instead, observe that subtracting 8 from 10 yields 2, a useful intermediate. Use this 2 in combination with 11: 11 + 2 = 13, still distant from",

Valid moves must involve only the original numbers or values derived through permitted operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\u2014without assuming or creating intermediate values that cannot be explicitly obtained from the initial set. Moves that attempt to generate numbers like 2, 4, or 5 without proper derivation are invalid. \n\nEffective strategies involve reducing the set toward 24 by combining numbers to approach it directly or through intermediate steps that are achievable. For example, combining 8 and 10 to get 80 or 11 and 1 to get 11 are less promising unless they lead to a clear path to 24. Conversely, operations that produce large or unrelated numbers, such as multiplying 11 by 2 (which is not initially available), are invalid and do not contribute to a promising solution. \n\nCrucially, any move that relies on introducing new numbers not present in"

The recent attempt\u2014subtracting 8 from 10 to get 2\u2014was a valid first move, leaving the remaining numbers 2 and 11. The challenge now is to determine how to combine these remaining numbers to reach 24, if possible, while adhering strictly to game rules.\n\n**Key Insights from Recent Attempts:**\n\n1. **Initial Valid Move:**  \n   Subtracting 8 from 10 (`10 - 8 = 2`) is a legal and strategic opening. It reduces the problem to working with 2 and 11, both of which are straightforward to manipulate through basic operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014without reusing any number more than once.\n\n2. **Limitations in Combining Remaining Numbers:**  \n   After obtaining 2 and 11, the goal is to reach 24. Possible operations include:  \n   - `11 + 11 + 2` \u2014 invalid, as it uses 11 twice without a second 11 in the original set.  \n   - `11 * 2 = 22` \u2014 close but not 24, and applying this step is valid.  \n   - To reach 24 from 22, an additional 2 would be needed, but there are no remaining numbers to add or multiply appropriately.  \n   \n   Therefore, simple operations between 2 and 11 do not directly produce 24, indicating that the path must involve combining the original numbers differently or in more complex ways.\n\n3. **Operation Legality and Step Validity:**  \n   The previous attempt\u2019s second step was flagged as illegal because it either misused numbers, combined numbers improperly, or performed operations not permissible under the rules. In the game, each operation must use only the current set of numbers, and each",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for 1, 8, 10, 11 in Game of 24:\n\nEffective moves are those that systematically combine available numbers using valid operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014to progress toward 24. Valid intermediate results must be directly derivable from the initial set or previously obtained values, avoiding the creation of unsubstantiated numbers. Moves producing numbers like 2 or 11 are promising if they enable further operations toward 24; for example, combining 8 and 10 to form 80 or subtracting 11 from 11. Conversely, moves leading to dead ends\u2014such as producing 1, 8,"

The key is to focus on valid operations, logical sequencing, and exploiting combinations that can lead to 24 without violating game rules.\n\n**1. Prioritize Valid Opening Moves**  \nA promising initial step, as evidenced by previous attempts, is to combine larger numbers to reduce complexity early on. For example, subtracting smaller numbers from larger ones\u2014like `10 - 8 = 2`\u2014creates manageable intermediate results. This move is both legal and strategic because it simplifies the set while conserving the original numbers for subsequent operations. Starting with `10 - 8 = 2`, leaves the set `{1, 11, 2}`, which is more conducive to reaching 24 through straightforward calculations.\n\n**2. Focus on Combining Remaining Numbers to Reach 24**  \nAfter such an initial move, the challenge shifts to combining the remaining numbers `{1, 11, 2}` to reach 24. Since `11 * 2 = 22` is close but falls short, consider operations that add or multiply to bridge the gap to 24. For instance:\n\n- `11 + 2 = 13` (not close enough)\n- `11 * 2 = 22`, then adding 2 or 1 isn\u2019t possible as they\u2019ve been used, so look for alternative pathways.\n\nAlternatively, if we can generate 12 or 24 directly from the remaining numbers, that would be optimal.\n\n**3. Exploit the Use of Multiplication and Division for Larger Results**  \nMultiplication is powerful for reaching larger targets quickly. For example:\n\n- `8 * 3 = 24`, but 3 isn\u2019t an original number, so we\u2019d need to generate 3 from existing numbers (e.g., `1 + 2 = 3`).  \n- From the initial set, combining `1 + 2 = 3` is valid if we\u2019ve created 2 in previous steps.\n\nThis suggests a strategy:\n\n- Use `10 - 8 =",

For example, subtract 8 from 10 to produce 2 (`10 - 8 = 2`), leaving the set {1, 11, 2}. This reduces complexity and opens pathways for straightforward calculations.\n\nNext, explore ways to generate key intermediary values\u2014particularly 3, 12, or 24\u2014using the remaining numbers. Since `1 + 2 = 3` is a simple and valid step, and `11 - 8 = 3` is also possible if 8 remains available, focus on creating 3 efficiently. Once 3 is available, multiplying it by 8 yields 24 (`3 * 8 = 24`). To do this, first generate 3, then multiply by 8:\n\n- Generate 3: either `11 - 8 = 3` (if 8 is still present) or `1 + 2 = 3` (if 2 is available).  \n- Multiply 3 by 8: `3 * 8 = 24`.\n\nThis approach hinges on creating 3 without invalid operations.

The previous attempt to subtract 8 from 11 to produce 3 is valid initially, but subsequent steps must involve only the remaining numbers without violating game rules.\n\nKey strategies:\n\n1. **Avoid invalid reuse or dropping numbers:** After creating 3 from 11 - 8, only use the current set {1, 3} to reach 24. Combining these directly is impossible, so focus on generating intermediate targets like 12 or 8 to help reach 24.\n\n2. **Generate helpful intermediates early:** For example, adding 10 and 1 yields 11, but since 11 is given, look for other combinations. Multiplying 8 by 3 gives 24 if you can produce 3, but generating 3 from 11 - 8 is valid; the mistake is attempting to reuse 8 after subtracting it.\n\n3.",

Moves are promising if they:\n\n1. **Utilize Only Current Numbers:** Combine two numbers present in the current set without introducing external or previously used numbers unless explicitly derived from prior steps. Each operation should produce a new, valid intermediate result.\n\n2. **Follow Allowed Operations:** Employ only addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), or division (\u00f7). Reusing numbers improperly or manipulating consumed values without proper replacement renders the move invalid.\n\n3. **Create Versatile Intermediates:** Aim for results that facilitate reaching 24\u2014values like 2, 3, 4, or 8 are particularly useful. For instance, generating a 3 or 2 from the initial numbers opens pathways to multiply or add toward the target.\n\n4. **Maintain Progress Toward 24:** Prefer moves that directly or indirectly move closer to 24. For example, multiplying 8 by 3 (if obtainable) or combining 10 with other intermediates can be promising steps.\n\nSpecifically"

Key insights include:\n\n1. **Respect number usage:** Each number can only be used once. Avoid operations like \"1 + 1\" unless two '1's are present. Since only one '1' exists, such steps are invalid.\n\n2. **Generate intermediate targets without reusing or dropping numbers improperly:** For example, subtracting 8 from 11 yields 3, which is valid and leaves {1, 3, 10}. From there, explore multiplying 3 by 8 or 10, but ensure operations follow game rules.\n\n3. **Prioritize operations that produce divisors or multiples of 24:** For instance, multiplying 8 by 3 (after generating 3 from 11 - 8) yields 24. To do this, first generate 3 correctly (11 - 8), then multiply by 8. Be cautious: after subtracting 8 from 11, you have {1, 3, 10}.\n\n4.",

The following principles refine the evaluation criteria:\n\n1. **Use Only Current Numbers Without Repetition:**  \n   Each move must combine two numbers present in the current set, producing a new number without reusing or artificially creating additional instances of a number unless explicitly derived from previous steps. For example, combining '1 + 1' is invalid if only one '1' exists in the current set. Moves that require or imply multiple identical numbers when only one is available are illegitimate.\n\n2. **Adhere Strictly to Allowed Operations:**  \n   Operations are limited to addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7). Improper reuse of numbers or manipulating consumed numbers without proper replacement constitutes an invalid move. For instance, attempting to divide by a number that is no longer available or reusing a number without proper operation invalidates the move.\n\n3. **Generate Facilitating Intermediate Results:**  \n   Effective moves often produce intermediate results that open pathways toward 24\u2014particularly common factors or small integers like 2, 3, 4, or 8.

For example, subtracting 8 from 11 yields 3 (11 - 8 = 3). This leaves the set {1, 3, 10}.  \n   - From {1, 3, 10}, look for ways to produce 24 by multiplying or adding, noting that 8 and 11 are no longer directly available unless recreated through operations.\n\n2. **Focus on generating factors of 24 or combinations that sum to 24:**  \n   - For example, multiplying 3 by 8 yields 24, but since 8 is not available after initial steps unless reused, this is invalid unless 8 remains.  \n   - Alternatively, consider multiplying 8 by 3 after generating 3 from 11 - 8, but this requires that 8 is still available, which it is.  \n   \n3. **Sequence of operations for a valid solution:**\n   - First, create 3: (11 - 8) = 3.  \n   - Use 8 and 3 to get 24: (3 * 8) = 24.  \n   - Remaining numbers after these steps are 1 and 10.  \n   - Check if remaining 1 and 10",

The following refined criteria synthesize previous insights and recent learnings to guide move evaluation:\n\n1. **Legality and Proper Use of Current Numbers:**  \n   Every operation must combine two numbers that are present in the current set without reusing or artificially generating additional instances unless explicitly derived from previous steps. For example, combining '1 + 1' is invalid if only one '1' exists. Moves that attempt to use a number not available in the current set or that rely on multiple copies when only one exists are invalid. Moreover, once a number is used in an operation, it should not be reused unless it results from a previous valid operation that produces multiple instances.\n\n2. **Operation Constraints and Proper Number Consumption:**  \n   Allowed operations are addition (+), subtraction (\u2212), multiplication (\u00d7), and division (\u00f7). Each move must consume exactly two numbers from the current set, producing a single new number. The remaining numbers are carried forward unchanged unless they are used in the operation. Moves that involve reusing a number without proper replacement or that manipulate numbers outside their availability are invalid. For example, dividing by a number that has already been used or dropping numbers without valid derivation violates these rules.\n\n3. **Accurate Tracking of Remaining Numbers:**  \n   After each move, the set of remaining numbers must be updated correctly by removing the two numbers used in the operation and adding the resulting number. This precise bookkeeping is essential for evaluating subsequent moves. For the specific set {1, 8, 10, 11}, any move that results in dropping a number improperly or creating a situation where the"

This step simplifies the set and creates a promising factor (3). Next, examine multiplying 3 by 8 to reach 24 (3 * 8 = 24); since 8 is still available after the subtraction, this is valid.

Start by exploring simple operations: adding or subtracting to reach key targets. Recognize that 10 + 11 = 21, which is close to 24; adding 3 (from 11 - 8) to 21 gives 24, but since 3 is derived from 11 - 8, use this sequence: (11 - 8) = 3, then (10 + 11) = 21, and finally 21 + 3 = 24. Alternatively, consider multiplying 8 by 3",

Moves must combine exactly two current numbers using valid operations, with careful management of remaining numbers to prevent logical errors. For example, after each move, remove the used numbers and add the resulting value back into the set, ensuring no reuse beyond their derivation.\n\nLegal moves require selecting only available numbers; attempting operations with nonexistent or improperly reused numbers invalidates the move. For instance, combining '1 + 1' is only valid if two separate '1's are present. Divisions must avoid dividing by zero, and all calculations must respect the current set's composition.\n\nStrategically, each move should aim to advance towards 24 efficiently\u2014either by directly approaching the target, simplifying the remaining calculations, or reducing the complexity of subsequent steps. Moves that generate intermediate values close to 24 or that create opportunities for straightforward final operations are more promising. Conversely, moves that lead to dead ends or complex, unwieldy intermediate numbers are"

Recognize that straightforward combinations like 10 + 11 = 21, and adding 3 (from 11 - 8), can approach 24; thus, consider sequences where (11 - 8) = 3 and (10 + 11) = 21, then combine these to reach 24 via addition: (21 + 3) = 24. Alternatively, multiplying 8 by 3 (from 11 - 8) yields 24 directly, but ensure the intermediate steps are valid with the current numbers at each stage. Avoid approaches that reuse or drop numbers illegally; each step must only involve the remaining numbers. Since the previous attempt showed that adding 8 and 11 to get 19 is valid, but subsequent operations using these results are invalid if they don't follow the rules, plan operations that keep within the remaining set at",

Moves must combine exactly two available numbers using valid operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014without reuse beyond their initial derivation, and must respect the current set's composition. For instance, combining '1 + 1' is only valid if two separate '1's are present; attempting this with a single '1' is invalid. Divisions must avoid dividing by zero, and all calculations should maintain logical consistency.\n\nStrategically, each move should aim to progress toward 24 efficiently. Moves that produce intermediate results close to 24 or that simplify remaining calculations are more promising. For example, combining numbers to generate a value near 24 or to create an intermediate that readily leads to 24 enhances the likelihood of success. Conversely, moves that produce unwieldy or irrelevant intermediate numbers\u2014like overly large or awkward values\u2014tend to hinder progress and should be avoided. Additionally, moves should minimize the creation of dead ends; if a move leads to a set of remaining numbers with no straightforward path to 24, it is less promising.\n\nFrom recent insights, it's clear that careful"

Key strategies involve identifying simple combinations that approach 24 and then manipulating remaining numbers to reach the target. \n\nStart by examining potential pairings:  \n- Multiplying or adding numbers that produce values near 24, such as 8 \u00d7 3 (where 3 is derived from 11 - 8). For example, (11 - 8) = 3, then multiply 8 by 3: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24.  \n- Alternatively, consider adding 10 + 11 = 21, then adding 3 (obtained via 11 - 8) to approach 24: (21 + 3) = 24. This approach uses the difference between 11 and 8 to generate 3, then combines it with sums involving 10 and 11.  \n- Recognize that subtracting 1 from 11 yields 10, which can pair with the remaining 8 to reach 18; however, this is less direct. Focus on operations involving differences (11 - 8) = 3 and sums that yield values close to 24.\n\nCrucially, each step must involve",

Moves should aim to produce intermediate results that are close to 24 or facilitate reaching it, avoiding unwieldy or irrelevant outcomes. For example, combining 8 and 10 via addition yields 18, a manageable intermediate, whereas producing overly large or awkward numbers (e.g., 110) hampers progress. It\u2019s crucial to consider the remaining numbers after each move; selecting operations that keep versatile options open and avoid dead ends increases success likelihood.

The primary strategy involves using the difference between 11 and 8, which yields 3 (11 - 8 = 3), as a foundational step. This operation is legal and simplifies the problem by creating a manageable intermediate value.\n\nAfter establishing 3, the remaining numbers are 1, 10, and 3. Subsequent operations must only involve these leftover numbers, respecting the rule that no number is reused or introduced anew. For example, you can combine 10 and 3 via addition or subtraction:  \n- 10 + 3 = 13 (not directly useful here),  \n- 10 - 3 = 7, or  \n- 1 + 10 = 11, etc.\n\nThe goal is to manipulate these remaining values to reach 24. Since 11 is in the set, consider operations like:  \n- 11 + 13 (if achievable), or  \n- Adding/subtracting to get close to 24, such as combining 10 and 3 to get 7, and then adding 1 to reach 8, or multiplying if possible.\n\nHowever, the recent feedback emphasizes that any step must strictly use only the numbers present after the previous step, without reusing or reintroducing numbers outside the current set. For example, after the initial step (11 - 8 = 3), attempting to use 11 again is illegal, as it was only available before the first step.\n\nTherefore, an effective approach is:  \n1. Perform 11 - 8 = 3 (sure, as it is correct and uses only the initial numbers).  \n2. Use 10 and 3 to reach 24",

Moves should prioritize producing intermediate results that bring the total closer to 24 or open pathways toward it, avoiding wild or unwieldy outcomes. For example, combining 8 and 10 via addition yields 18, a manageable intermediate, whereas producing overly large or awkward numbers (e.g., 110) can hinder progress. It\u2019s crucial to evaluate the remaining numbers after each move, favoring operations that preserve versatility and avoid dead ends. Recent insights reveal that creating intermediate values like 3, 9, or 11 often indicates limited future pathways, so moves resulting in such numbers should be scrutinized for their strategic value.\n\nFrom the latest analysis, initial steps that produce valid intermediate results \u2014 such as subtracting 8 from 11 to get 3 \u2014 are promising if they set up further flexible operations. However, illegal moves typically involve attempting to reuse or operate on numbers that are no longer available, violating game rules.

The key is to recognize which operations are permissible and how to manipulate the initial set without reusing or reintroducing values outside the original numbers.\n\n**Core Principles for the 1, 8, 10, 11 Puzzle:**\n\n1. **Use Only the Original Numbers and Basic Operations:**  \n   All operations must involve the initial numbers (1, 8, 10, 11) without creating or assuming new values. For example, creating 2 via division or subtraction is only valid if 2 is directly obtained from the original set or through permissible operations involving the original numbers.\n\n2. **No Reuse or Reintroduction of Numbers:**  \n   Once a number is used in an operation, it cannot be reused unless explicitly combined to produce a new number, which then becomes a new element for subsequent steps. The process must proceed with the remaining numbers after each operation, respecting the sequence and legality.\n\n3. **Focus on Legal Intermediate Steps:**  \n   The recent feedback highlighted an attempt to perform `10 / 2`, which was invalid because 2 was not part of the initial set. This underscores the importance of ensuring that every intermediate or derived number is either in the original set or obtained legitimately from previous steps.\n\n4. **Leverage Differences and Sum Combinations to Reach 24:**  \n   Since 24 is a multiple of 8, and 8 is directly in the set, a promising approach is to manipulate the other numbers to produce 8, 10, or 11 in ways that combine to 24. For instance, combining 8 with other derived values or using differences to get manageable numbers.\n\n5. **Strategic Steps for the Current Set:**  \n   - **Identify easy pathways to 24:**",
                    "value_summary": "Refined Evaluation Model for the 1, 8, 10, 11 Puzzle\n\nWhen approaching the 1, 8, 10, 11 puzzle, effective move selection hinges on strategic operations that progressively steer the combined results toward 24. Moves should be evaluated based on their capacity to produce intermediate values that are manageable, versatile, and conducive to reaching the target. Valid operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but they must respect the current set of available numbers\u2014no reuse or operation on already consumed numbers unless the game rules permit.\n\nKey principles derived from recent insights are:\n\n1. **Validity of Operations:** Only perform operations on available numbers. Attempting to operate on or reuse numbers no longer in the set is invalid and should be avoided. For example, dividing 10 by 2 is invalid if '2' isn't part of the initial set or result from previous steps.\n\n2. **Intermediate Results as Guides:** Moves that produce manageable and flexible intermediate results\u2014such as 3, 8, or 11\u2014are promising, as they often open multiple pathways. Conversely, creating unwieldy or overly large numbers (like 110) can hinder progress. For instance, combining 8 and 10 via addition yields 18, a manageable intermediate closer to 24.\n\n3. **Prioritizing Closeness to 24:** Moves should aim to produce results that are closer to 24 or set up future operations that can reach 24 efficiently. For example, subtracting 8 from 11 yields 3, which may be useful in subsequent steps to reach 24 via multiplication or addition.\n\n4. **Preservation of Flexibility:** After each move, evaluate remaining numbers for their potential to"

Each step must derive new values solely through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of these initial numbers, ensuring intermediate results are valid and permissible.\n\nKey strategies include:\n\n1. **Prioritize Utilizing the 8:**  \n   Since 8 is a straightforward multiple of 24 (8 x 3 = 24), seek to generate 3 from the remaining numbers (1, 10, 11). Avoid using any derived number not directly obtainable from the original set.\n\n2. **Generate 3 from 10 and 11 Carefully:**  \n   To produce 3, consider differences such as 11 - 8 = 3, but since 8 is already in the set, this is valid. Alternatively, use subtraction between 10 and 11 (which yields 1), then combine with other operations. For example, 11 - 10 = 1, and 10 - 8 = 2, but these don\u2019t directly help reach 24 unless combined strategically.\n\n3. **Combine Differences and Sums to Reach 24:**  \n   Recognize that 8 * 3 = 24, so the goal is to produce 3 from the",

For instance, subtracting 8 from 11 yields 3, which can serve as a strategic stepping stone in subsequent multiplications or additions. Conversely, creating unwieldy or large numbers (like 110 from 10\u00d711) hampers progress and should be avoided.\n\nMoves should also aim to reduce the gap to 24, either directly or by setting up future operations that facilitate reaching the"

This directly uses the original numbers without introducing new values. It simplifies the path toward 24 because 12 is a useful intermediate.\n\n2. **Utilize the Remaining Numbers to Reach 24:**  \n   After creating 12, the goal is to multiply it by 2 to reach 24. The remaining numbers after `(11 + 1)` are `8` and `10`. To produce `2`, consider subtracting `8` from `10`:  \n   `10 - 8 = 2`.  \n   This step is valid and uses only the original numbers.\n\n3. **Combine the Results in a Final Step:**  \n   With `12` (from `(11 + 1)`) and `2` (from `10 - 8`), multiply:  \n   `12 * 2 = 24`.  \n   This yields the target number directly.\n\n4. **Sequence of Operations:**  \n   - Step 1: `(11 + 1) = 12` (remaining numbers: 8, 10)  \n   - Step 2: `10 - 8 = 2` (remaining number: 12, 2)  \n   - Step 3: `12 * 2 = 24` (all numbers used)  \n\nThis sequence respects the constraints: only initial numbers are used, each operation is valid, and no extraneous or repeated use of numbers occurs.\n\n5. **Key Takeaways for Strategy:**\n   - Prioritize pairing larger numbers with smaller ones to generate intermediate multiples or useful values.  \n   - Use",
                    "value_summary": "Refined Evaluation Model for the 1, 8, 10, 11 Puzzle\n\nWhen assessing moves, prioritize operations that produce manageable, flexible intermediate results closer to 24, while strictly adhering to the rule of using each number exactly once per move. Valid operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, performed only on available numbers. Moves that generate simple, versatile intermediate values\u2014such as small numbers (e.g., 3), or sums/differences like 8, 11, or 2\u2014are more promising, as these facilitate subsequent steps toward 24. For example, deriving 3 by subtracting 8 from 11 (11 - 8 = 3) creates a useful intermediary that can be multiplied or added to reach 24 more efficiently. Conversely, producing unwieldy or large numbers (e.g., 110 from 10\u00d711) tends to hinder progress and should generally be avoided.\n\nEffective strategies involve reducing the gap to 24 either directly or by setting up future operations. For instance, subtracting 8 from 11 yields 3, which can be multiplied by 8 to reach 24 (8\u00d73=24). Similarly, combining 10 and 1 through addition (10+1=11) or other operations should be evaluated for their potential to produce intermediate results that simplify subsequent calculations.\n\nIn the specific case of the numbers 1, 8, 10, 11, initial moves like 10 - 8 = 2 are promising, as they produce small, flexible numbers that can serve as stepping stones."

Past attempts reveal that straightforward summations or multiplications involving all four numbers often overshoot or fall short, so consider combining smaller pairs first to create intermediate values closer to 24.\n\nStart by pairing the two 11s:  \n**Step 1:** 11 + 11 = 22  \nRemaining numbers: 1, 13, and the result 22.\n\nNext, evaluate how to reach 24:  \n- Since 22 is close to 24, adding 2 would suffice, but 2 isn't directly available.  \n- To generate 2, consider subtracting from 13 or 1:  \n  - 13 - 11 = 2 (but we've already used 11s; if we use them to make 22 first, this approach is valid).  \n  - Alternatively, use the 1 to generate 2:  \n    - 13 - 11 = 2 (but that uses the 13 and 11).  \n    - Or, from the remaining 1, 13 - 11 = 2 is promising, but since 13 and 11 are used separately, we can think about pairing 13 and 11 to get 2 if they haven't been combined before.\n\nGiven the previous unsuccessful attempts with direct sums, consider the following refined approach:  \n- Pair",

For example, **11 + 11 = 22** is promising because it yields a total close to 24, simplifying the path to the goal.\n\n2. **Utilize the Remaining Numbers Effectively:**  \nAfter forming 22, focus on the remaining numbers: 1 and 13. The key is to find operations that combine these into 2 or 24 with minimal steps.  \n- For instance, **13 - 11 = 2** is a valid move, but must be carefully checked for proper usage: both 13 and 11 are available initially, so this operation is legal. After this, the remaining numbers are 1, 11, and 2.  \n- Alternatively, combining 13 and 1 to get 14 (13 + 1 = 14) then subtracting 11 to get 3 (14 - 11 = 3) can be useful, but more steps are needed.\n\n3. **Avoid Reusing or Invalid Operations:**  \nOperations must only use each number once, and the intermediate results should be derived from the original numbers without reusing or reinterpreting the same number multiple times.  \n- For example, if you used 13 and 11 to get 2, you cannot then reuse 13 or 11 again",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 24 game for the set {1, 11, 11, 13}, our refined model emphasizes the strategic importance of reducing large or repetitive numbers while avoiding dead-ends that hinder reaching 24. The initial set {1, 11, 11, 13} is always considered a 'sure' starting point, as it accurately reflects the available numbers for operations.\n\nMoving to the first step, the move of subtracting 11 from 13 to produce 2 is generally promising because it reduces a large number (13) and avoids creating an unmanageable dead-end. This move is legal if the game rules allow combining any two numbers once per step, and the resulting set becomes {1, 11, 2}. \n\nHowever, in this specific scenario, the evaluation indicates that the move was deemed 'impossible.' This suggests that certain move constraints\u2014such as not reusing numbers improperly or following specific operation rules\u2014must be strictly adhered to. The key insight is that moves which significantly reduce large numbers, especially when such reduction leads to smaller, more manageable numbers like 2, are promising for progressing toward 24.\n\nFurthermore, avoiding the creation of dead-ends\u2014states where remaining numbers cannot combine to reach 24\u2014is critical. For instance, after the move resulting in {1, 11, 2}, further steps should aim to combine the 11 and 2 to get 13, then combine with 1 to reach 14, which still doesn't achieve"

The most straightforward approach is to add them: **11 + 11 = 22**. This yields a value close to 24, simplifying subsequent steps. Alternatively, subtracting one 11 from the other (**11 - 11 = 0**) or multiplying (**11 \u00d7 11 = 121**) are options, but these are less promising for reaching 24 efficiently. The goal is to create a manageable intermediate like 22, which can be combined with other numbers to reach 24.\n\n2. **Use the Remaining Numbers to Reach 24 Efficiently:**  \nAfter forming 22 from the 11s, consider how to incorporate 13 and 1. Since **24 - 22 = 2**, the key is to find a way to produce 2 from 13 and 1 or from the leftover operations.  \n- For example, **13 - 11 = 2** is valid if you have an 11 available, but remember, after pairing the 11s, you are left with the 13 and 1.  \n- You can try to generate 2 by **13 - 11 = 2**, but only if you haven't used both 11s already.  \n- Alternatively, consider **13 - 11 = 2** before combining the 11s, but since the 11s are identical, it's best to perform operations with one 11 at a time.\n\n3. **Avoid Reusing or Dropping Numbers Illegally:**  \nEvery move must strictly utilize the original numbers without reusing or dropping any. Once an operation combines specific numbers, those are replaced by the result",
                    "value_summary": "In the context of the 24 game with the set {1, 11, 11, 13}, effective moves prioritize reducing large or repetitive numbers to facilitate reaching 24. Eliminating or decreasing high values like 13 often opens productive pathways, especially when combined with smaller numbers such as 1 or 11. Moves that subtract or divide large numbers to produce manageable intermediate results (e.g., 2 or 3) are promising, as they help break down the problem into simpler components. Conversely, attempts that leave the set in a state where remaining numbers cannot logically combine to total 24\u2014such as {13, 11}\u2014are unpromising or impossible under the rules. The key is to avoid creating dead-ends by favoring operations that generate intermediate values conducive to subsequent combinations,"

This gives a value close to 24, simplifying the final steps. Alternatively, consider **11 - 11 = 0** if subtraction yields a useful pathway later, but addition is generally more promising for reaching 24. Multiplying the two 11s results in 121, which is less practical given the goal. The key is to produce 22 from the 11s, as it allows straightforward adjustments to reach 24.\n\n2. **Use Remaining Numbers to Reach 24 Using the Difference of 2**  \nAfter establishing 22 from the 11s, the remaining numbers are 13 and 1. Since **24 - 22 = 2**, the next step is to generate 2 from 13 and 1.  \n- Directly, **13 - 1 = 12**; this is close but not directly helpful to reach 2.  \n- Alternatively, consider **13 - 11 = 2**, but only if you haven't already used the 11s.  \n- You can also attempt to generate 2 from the 13 and 1 in other ways, such as **(13 - 11) = 2** if the 11 is still available, or **(13 - 11) = 2** before combining the 11s.\n\n3. **Prioritize Using the 13 and 1 to Generate 2**  \nSince the 13 and",

This step is promising because 22 is close to 24, requiring only an addition of 2 to reach 24.\n\nNext, generate the 2 needed to reach 24. The remaining numbers after combining the 11s are 13 and 1. To produce 2, consider operations involving these:\n\n- Since **13 - 11 = 2**, but 11 has already been used in creating 22, this operation is invalid unless the 11s are still available. If the 11s are already combined into 22, then 13 and 1 are left, and you cannot use the 11s again.\n\n- Alternatively, look for ways to produce 2 solely from 13 and 1. For example:\n  - **13 - 11** is invalid now, as 11 is already used.\n  - **13 - 1 = 12**, which is close but not directly helpful.\n  - **13 - 11** is only valid if the 11s are still available",

Every move must involve only the remaining available numbers.\n\n2. **Prioritize combining the two 11s early:** Since 11 + 11 = 22 is close to 24, this is a promising step. Creating 22 early gives a straightforward path to reach 24 by adding 2.\n\n3. **Generating the number 2:** The key challenge is producing 2 from the remaining numbers after combining the 11s. The remaining numbers after combining the 11s are 13 and 1. To produce 2, consider:\n   - **13 - 11** is invalid now if the 11s are already combined into 22, so avoid this unless the 11s are still separate.\n   - **13 - 1 = 12** is close but not directly helpful.\n   - Alternatively, look for ways to produce 2 solely from 13 and 1, but since 13 - 11 is invalid if 11s are used up, focus on the numbers remaining after the initial combination.\n\n4. **Combining the 11s first:**  \n   - **11 + 11 = 22**: This step is valid and yields a number close to 24.\n   - After forming 22, the leftover numbers are 13 and 1.\n\n5. **Creating 2 from 13 and 1:**  \n   - Since the initial 11s are now combined into 22, you cannot use the 11s again.\n   - From 13 and 1: **13 - 1 = 12** (not 2), so this isn't directly helpful.\n   - From 13 and 1, no straightforward operation yields 2.\n   - The only way to get 2 at this stage is if the 11s are still available and you can do **13 - 11 = 2**, but this requires the 11s to be unused at that moment.\n\n6. **Alternative approach\u2014look for other intermediate targets:**\n   - Consider **adding 13 and 1**: **13 + 1 = 14** (not directly useful).\n   - Consider **dividing 13 by 13**: yields 1, but not helpful here.\n   - Focus on the possibility of recreating 2 from other combinations if the initial plan fails.\n\n7. **Re-examining the initial steps based on previous feedback:**\n   - The move **11 * 1**",
                    "value_summary": "For the puzzle involving the numbers 1, 11, 11, and 13, effective evaluation of moves hinges on their impact on simplifying the set toward 24. Promising moves are those that produce manageable, small intermediate values\u2014particularly by subtracting or dividing large or repetitive numbers to generate small, versatile figures like 2 or 3\u2014facilitating subsequent combinations. Moves that attempt to use numbers not present in the current set (e.g., multiplying 11 by 1 when 1 is no longer available) are invalid and unpromising. Valid steps should involve pairing numbers within the current set, especially focusing on reducing high values like 11 or 13, or combining identical numbers such as 11 and 11, to create smaller, more flexible intermediates. Moves that maintain or return to the original set without illegal operations are considered '"

The challenge is creating 2 from the remaining numbers after forming 22.\n\n- **Initial move considerations:**\n\n  - Combining the two 11s: **11 + 11 = 22**.  \n    Remaining numbers: 13, 1, and the new 22.\n\n  - Now, to reach 24, we need to add 2 to 22. The only way to get 2 is from the remaining numbers.  \n    The remaining numbers are 13 and 1; since 13 - 11 isn't valid after the 11s are combined, and 13 - 1 = 12, which isn't 2, this approach doesn't directly yield 2 at this stage.\n\n- **Addressing the invalid move of '1 + 1':**  \n  Since only one '1' exists, combining it with itself is invalid. Any previous attempt that used '1 + 1' is incorrect for this set.\n\n- **Alternate pathways:**\n\n  - Consider pairing 13 and 1 first: **13 - 1 = 12**, which isn't immediately useful.\n  - Or, dividing",

The main constraints are: each original number (1, 11, 11, 13) can be used only once unless creating a new number intentionally, and you cannot reuse or drop numbers arbitrarily.\n\n**Step 1: Maximize the use of the 11s early**  \nCombining the two 11s is promising:  \n- **11 + 11 = 22**  \nThis yields a number close to 24, requiring only an addition of 2. Remaining numbers after this move are **13** and **1** (plus the new 22).  \nThis move is valid because both 11s are used exactly once.\n\n**Step 2: Generate 2 from remaining numbers**  \nTo reach 24, we need to add 2 to 22.  \n- Possible options:  \n  - Use 13 and 1:  \n    - 13 - 1 = 12 (not 2)  \n    - 13 - 11 (already used), so invalid here.  \n  - Use division or subtraction with remaining numbers:  \n    - 13 - 11 = 2 (but the 11 has already been used in the previous step, so cannot be reused).  \n    - 13 - 1 = 12, not helpful directly.  \n- Since 13 and 1 are left, and the 11s are already used, the only way to create 2 is through subtraction involving 13 and 11, but as shown, the 11s are exhausted after Step 1.\n\n**Step 3: Reconsider the initial pairing of 11s**  \nAlternatively, pairing 13 with 1:  \n- 13 - 1 = 12, which is not directly useful for reaching 24.  \n- Or, dividing 13 by 13 (not available, as only one 13 exists).  \n- Combining 11 and 13 differently:  \n  - 13 - 11 = 2 (possible if both 11s are still available).  \n  - If we",

Moves that reduce 11s or 13 into manageable values often open pathways to reach 24. Combining identical numbers, such as the two 11s, can produce small, versatile results (e.g., 11 - 11 = 0 or 11 / 11 = 1), which are advantageous for constructing the final solution. Eliminating large numbers early by operations that produce small, reusable intermediates is beneficial, especially when it simplifies subsequent calculations.\n\nConversely, moves that attempt to reuse numbers already used or produce unwieldy, large intermediate results are less promising. For example, trying to subtract 1 from 11 to get 10 is valid, but subsequent steps must be carefully considered; if the move uses a number not available at that stage, it is invalid. Validity depends strictly on using each initial number once unless explicitly replaced. Moves that produce results like 13 or 11 directly without further reduction tend to complicate the path toward 24, especially if they do not lead to small intermediates.\n\nFor this specific"

Past attempts reveal that understanding the precise rules of number usage and sequence is critical. Specifically, each of the original numbers can be used exactly once per operation, and each operation's result replaces the two numbers used. No number can be reused or dropped arbitrarily, and the sequence must maintain consistency regarding leftover numbers.\n\n**Key Insights from Past Attempts:**\n\n1. **Using the 11s Early Is Promising but Requires Care:**  \nCombining the two 11s early to make 22 is intuitive because 22 is close to 24, and adding 2 would reach 24. The move:  \n`11 + 11 = 22`  \nleaves the set {22, 13, 1}.  \nNext, the goal is to generate 2, which can be added to 22. But forming 2 from remaining numbers is tricky because:  \n- Using 13 and 1 alone yields 12, not helpful.  \n- Using 13 and 11 is not valid here because the 11s have already been used in the first step.  \n- Using 13 and 1 yields 12, which is not 2.\n\n2. **Attempting to Generate 2 from Remaining Numbers Could Fail if Not Carefully Tracked:**  \nFor example, if you try `13 - 11 = 2`, this is valid mathematically, but after doing so, the leftover set should be {1, 11, 2}. Notably, the original 13 and 11 are used to produce 2, so they are no longer available for further operations unless specifically reintroduced.\n\n3. **Correct Handling of Leftover Numbers is Critical:**  \nIn previous attempts, misrepresenting the remaining set after an operation led to invalid solutions. For example, after `13 - 11 = 2`, the remaining numbers should be the original numbers not used in the operation plus the new 2, i.e., {1, 11, 2}. But if the leftover set is incorrectly written as {2, 13, 1}, it indicates a misunderstanding of the rules. The operation must remove the two numbers used and replace them with the result.\n\n4. **Legal Moves Must Respect the State of the Set:**  \nEach move reduces the total number of elements by one. The process continues until a single number remains, ideally 24. To achieve this, moves must be carefully planned to combine numbers to get close to 24, then fine-tune the result.\n\n---\n\n### **Ref",
                    "value_summary": "**Refined Evaluation Model for the 1, 11, 11, 13 Puzzle**\n\nEffective moves in this set focus on transforming large or repetitive numbers into small, versatile intermediates\u2014primarily 2 or 3\u2014using valid operations like subtraction or division. Moves that reduce the two 11s into 0 or 1 (e.g., 11 - 11 = 0 or 11 / 11 = 1) are particularly promising, as they create flexible building blocks for reaching 24. Early elimination of high numbers, especially through operations yielding small, reusable intermediates, simplifies subsequent calculations.\n\nCrucially, each move must respect the initial number usage: no number can be reused or combined more than once unless explicitly replaced, ensuring move validity. For example, subtracting 11 from 13 to obtain 2 is invalid if 13 and 11 haven't been combined beforehand. Valid operations are limited to pairs of numbers currently available, and their results should ideally facilitate further reduction toward 24.\n\nMoves producing large intermediate results or that do not simplify the set are less promising, especially if they do not lead to small, flexible"

Here are the core, actionable insights:\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining the 11s Early to Create a Near-Target Total**  \nCombining the two 11s early is promising because:  \n`11 + 11 = 22`  \nThis results in a total close to 24, where only a small adjustment is needed.  \nAlternatively, subtracting them:  \n`13 - 11 = 2`  \nalso produces a useful small number, but must be used carefully, respecting the rules about which numbers are available after each step.\n\n2. **Careful Handling of the Remaining Set After Each Operation**  \nWhen combining two numbers, remove those from the current set and replace them with the operation result. For example,  \n`13 - 11 = 2`  \nfrom the original set {1, 11, 11, 13} leaves:  \nRemaining numbers: 1, 11, 2  \nThis is valid if the operation is performed correctly and the set updated accordingly.\n\n3. **Avoid Reusing Numbers or Repeating Operations Invalidly**  \nThe previous attempt incorrectly used `13 + 11 = 24` after creating 2 via `13 - 11`, which is invalid because after `13 - 11`, those numbers are no longer available for subsequent operations.  \nAlways ensure the set after an operation reflects only the unused original numbers plus the new result.\n\n4. **Focus on Generating 24 from the Updated Set**  \nOnce the set contains 24 (e.g., from `11 + 11 = 22`, then adding 2), the goal is to reach exactly 24.  \nFor example, if you have {22, 2, 1}, then:  \n`22 + 2 = 24`  \nand the remaining number 1 can be disregarded",
                    "value_summary": "**Refined Evaluation Model for the 1, 11, 11, 13 Puzzle**\n\nEffective moves prioritize transforming larger or repetitive numbers into small, flexible intermediates\u2014particularly 2 or 3\u2014using valid operations like subtraction or division. Creating 0 or 1 from the two 11s (e.g., 11 - 11 = 0 or 11 / 11 = 1) is especially advantageous, as these small results serve as versatile building blocks toward 24. Early elimination of high or redundant numbers simplifies subsequent steps, reducing complexity.\n\nCrucially, each move must adhere to strict usage rules: numbers can only be used once unless explicitly replaced, ensuring move validity. For example, using 13 after it has been combined or used elsewhere violates rules, making such moves invalid. Valid operations are limited to pairs of currently available numbers, and the resulting intermediate should ideally facilitate further reduction toward 24.\n\nMoves that produce large, unwieldy intermediate results or fail to reduce the set into smaller, more manageable numbers are generally less promising. Similarly, moves that do not respect the initial number constraints\u2014such as reusing a number without proper replacement\u2014are invalid and unlikely to"

Here's a concise, targeted strategy tailored for this specific set:\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining the Two 11s Early**  \nThe two 11s offer a promising starting point because their sum is close to 24:  \n`11 + 11 = 22`  \nThis creates a large intermediate value near the target, simplifying subsequent adjustments. Alternatively, subtracting them:  \n`11 - 11 = 0`  \nproduces a small number, but using the sum approach generally provides more straightforward pathways toward 24.\n\n2. **Manage the Remaining Set Carefully After Each Operation**  \nWhen combining two numbers, ensure the original set is correctly updated: remove the used numbers and add the operation result. For example, after `11 + 11 = 22`, the remaining numbers are `{1, 13, 22}`. This step is valid only if the set accurately reflects the numbers available. Proper bookkeeping prevents invalid reuse or dropping of numbers.\n\n3. **Leverage the Near-Target Total to Reach 24**  \nFollowing the creation of 22, adding the remaining `2` (if generated) to reach 24 is optimal. For instance, if you derive `2` by subtracting 13 from 11:  \n`13 - 11 = 2`  \nthen, with the set `{1, 22, 2}`, you can perform:  \n`22 + 2 = 24`  \nwhich completes the goal efficiently.\n\n4. **Avoid Invalid Reuse of Intermediate Results**  \nThe recent attempt highlighted a common pitfall: reusing a combined value (`24`) obtained from previous steps as if it were an original number in subsequent operations. This is invalid unless explicitly carried over as a new number, respecting the rules.\n\n5. **Construct Valid Pathways to 24**  \nA valid sequence based on these principles:\n\n- **Step 1:** Combine the two 11s:  \n`11 + 11",
                    "value_summary": "**Refined Evaluation Model for the 1, 11, 11, 13 Puzzle**\n\nEffective moves should focus on transforming larger or repetitive numbers into small, flexible intermediates\u2014preferably 2 or 3\u2014via valid operations such as subtraction or division. Creating 0 or 1 from the two 11s (e.g., 11 - 11 = 0 or 11 / 11 = 1) is especially advantageous, as these small results act as versatile building blocks for reaching 24. Early elimination of high or redundant numbers simplifies the remaining steps, reducing overall complexity.\n\nCrucially, all moves must strictly adhere to usage rules: each number can only be used once unless explicitly replaced, and no number should be reused improperly or omitted without replacement. For example, once a 13 has been combined into 24, it cannot be reused in subsequent steps unless explicitly reintroduced. Invalid moves\u2014such as combining numbers that are no longer available, reusing a used number without proper replacement, or producing intermediate results that do not facilitate further reduction\u2014are to be avoided, as they lead to dead ends or rule violations.\n\nMoves that"

Combining the 11s first yields a straightforward sum: (11 + 11) = 22, leaving remaining numbers 1 and 13 to work with. This is advantageous because 22 is close to 24, and adding a small number like 2 can complete the total.\n\nNext, generating the number 2 efficiently is critical. From the remaining numbers, subtracting 11 from 13 gives (13 - 11) = 2, which is a simple, legal step. This leaves the set: 1, 2, and the remaining 11s, but the key is to utilize the 2 to reach 24.\n\nThe final step involves adding 22 and 2: (22 + 2) = 24, completing the solution. This sequence is valid, uses each number exactly once, and aligns with the constraints.\n\n**Actionable Strategy Summary:**\n\n1. **Combine the two 11s first:**  \n   `11 + 11 = 22`  \n   Remaining numbers: {1, 13, 22}\n\n2. **Create a 2 from 13 and 11:**  \n   `13 - 11 = 2`  \n   Remaining numbers: {1, 22, 2}\n\n3. **Add 22 and ",
                    "value_summary": "Refined Evaluation Model for the 1, 11, 11, 13 Puzzle\n\nEffective strategies for solving the 1, 11, 11, 13 puzzle center on generating small, flexible intermediate numbers\u2014particularly 1, 2, or 3\u2014by applying valid operations such as subtraction or division to larger or duplicate numbers. Creating 0 or 1 from the two 11s (e.g., 11 - 11 = 0 or 11 / 11 = 1) is especially valuable because these results serve as versatile building blocks for reaching the target number 24 through addition or multiplication. Early generation of these small intermediates simplifies subsequent steps, reduces complexity, and makes reaching 24 more straightforward, minimizing dead ends.\n\nCrucially, move validity hinges on strict adherence to game rules: each original number can only be used once unless explicitly replaced, and no numbers can be reused or dropped improperly without proper replacement. For example, combining 13 and 11 to reach 24 consumes both numbers, and they cannot be reused unless reintroduced explicitly. Moves attempting to reuse or omit numbers incorrectly violate these rules, leading to invalid steps and dead ends. Ensuring each move respects the current set of remaining numbers is fundamental for effective problem-solving.\n\nFrom the recent analysis, the key insights are:\n\n1. Generating small, flexible values like 1, 2, or 3 early is promising because these can be combined easily to reach 24. For example, producing 1 via 11 / 11 or 13 - 11 offers versatile options for the final steps.\n\n2. Simplifying the number set by combining larger or redundant numbers early reduces complexity and prevents dead ends. For instance, using 13 - 11 = 2 efficiently transforms the initial set into a more manageable one.\n\n3. Moves that produce or retain small intermediates (1, 2, 3) are more promising, whereas moves attempting to reuse"

Doing so simplifies the pathway and leverages the proximity of their sum to 24. The most straightforward initial move is:\n\n1. **Combine the two 11s first:**  \n   `11 + 11 = 22`  \n   Remaining numbers: {1, 13, 22}  \n   \nThis step reduces complexity and positions us close to the target. Next, focus on creating a 2, crucial to bridging the gap to 24:\n\n2. **Create 2 from remaining numbers:**  \n   Since 13 and 11 are available, subtracting 11 from 13 yields:  \n   `13 - 11 = 2`  \n   Remaining numbers now: {1, 22, 2}  \n   \nThis is valid and aligns with the rules\u2014each number used exactly once, with operations applied correctly. Now, combine the 22 and 2:\n\n3. **Add 22 and 2:**  \n   `22 + 2 = 24`  \n\nThis completes the solution within the ruleset, using each number exactly once, with all steps valid and legal.\n\n**Key Insights for This Specific Puzzle:**\n\n- Prioritize combining the two 11",

Moves such as subtracting identical large numbers (e.g., 11 - 11 = 0) or dividing to produce 1 (11 / 11 = 1) are especially valuable because they simplify the problem and expand the range of subsequent options. Generating 1 or 2 early allows for straightforward combinations, such as 3 + 21 or 2 \u00d7 12, to reach 24 with minimal complexity.\n\nCrucially, each move must respect the rules: each original number can only be used once unless explicitly replaced, and no numbers can be reused improperly. Moves that produce small intermediates like 1 or 2 from larger numbers (e.g., 13 - 11 = 2) are highly promising, as they reduce the set size and"

Combining the pair of 11s first is advantageous because their sum (22) is close to the target, reducing the complexity of subsequent steps. The initial move should be:\n\n1. **Combine the two 11s:**  \n   `11 + 11 = 22`  \n   Remaining numbers: {1, 13, 22}  \n\nThis move consolidates two high-value numbers, leaving a smaller set to work with, and positions us near 24. Next, the critical step involves creating a 2, which acts as a bridge to reach 24 efficiently:\n\n2. **Create 2 from remaining numbers:**  \n   `13 - 11 = 2` (using 13 and one 11)  \n   Remaining numbers: {1, 22, 2}  \n\nAlternatively, since we have 13 and 11, subtracting 11 from 13 yields 2, which is a clean and legal move. Now, use the remaining 22 and 2:\n\n3. **Sum 22 and 2:**  \n   `22 + 2 = 24`  \n\nThis straightforward calculation yields the target value, completing the solution while adhering to the rules: each number is used exactly once, and only valid operations are performed.\n\n**Key Insights for This Specific Puzzle:**\n\n- **Prioritize combining the two 11s early** to reduce complexity and get close to 24. Their sum (22) is a convenient stepping stone.\n  \n- **Create a 2 by subtracting 11 from 13:**  \n  `13",

The key insight is to plan operations that utilize the original set without violating the constraints, especially avoiding the unwarranted creation of intermediate numbers like 22 from previous results.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Use the two 11s early and carefully:**  \n   Combining the two 11s to produce 22 is promising because 11 + 11 = 22 is near 24, simplifying subsequent steps. However, once you perform this operation, 22 becomes a new number not present initially, and further operations involving 22 must respect the rules\u2014i.e., you cannot generate 22 from previous results unless it was part of the original set. Therefore, this move is permissible only as the initial step, not as part of a chain of operations involving previously generated numbers.\n\n2. **Perform valid subtractions involving 13 and 11:**  \n   Subtracting 11 from 13 yields 2 (`13 - 11 = 2`), a valid operation that produces a number from the original set without violating rules. This step leaves you with the set {1, 11, 2} (assuming you started with {1, 11, 11, 13} and used one 11 and 13). Note that using the two 11s separately is valid, but combining them into 22 must be done immediately and only once.\n\n3. **Use remaining numbers to reach 24:**  \n   With 22 and 2 in hand, the straightforward approach is to add them: `22 + 2 = 24`.

The key is to recognize that combining the two 11s into 22 is permissible only immediately, as it creates a new number not originally present, but subsequent operations involving 22 must be carefully validated.\n\n**Core Actionable Strategies:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Using the Two 11s Right Away:**\n   - The most promising initial move is `11 + 11 = 22`, which brings the sum close to 24, reducing the complexity of subsequent steps.\n   - Alternatively, `11 - 11 = 0` is valid but less helpful unless specific manipulations suggest otherwise.\n   \n2. **Leverage the Difference Between 13 and 11:**\n   - Performing `13 - 11 = 2` is a straightforward, valid step that produces a small, manageable number.\n   - This move leaves your set as {1, 2}, assuming you\u2019ve used only one 11 and the 13.\n   - Remember, subtracting 11 from 13 is permissible and does not violate rules about intermediate number creation.\n\n3. **Use the Remaining Numbers to Reach 24:**\n   - After obtaining 2, the remaining numbers should be the original ones minus those used, which are 1, 11, 13, and the newly created 2.\n   - Combining 22 (from `11 + 11`) with 2 yields `22 + 2 = 24`, a direct route to the",

The strongest moves produce these small numbers early, such as dividing 11 by 11 to obtain 1, or subtracting 11 from 13 to produce 2. These small intermediates expand the set of possible operations, making it easier to reach 24 through addition or multiplication.\n\nCrucially, the legality of moves depends on operating within the current set of available numbers at each step. Any move must use only numbers present in the previous set; generating a new number (like 2) through an operation is only valid if that number was present beforehand. For example, transforming 13 and 11 into 2 via 13 - 11 = 2 is valid only if both 13 and 11 exist in the current set. Once a move is made, the updated set reflects the used numbers, and subsequent moves must"

Since no additional numbers are available, avoid operations that introduce non-integers or rely on numbers outside the initial set. Instead, identify operations that produce manageable factors directly from the given numbers.\n\nKey strategies include:\n\n1. Use subtraction to generate smaller numbers within the set, such as 1 or 2. For example, 8 - 6 = 2, which can help in forming 4 or other factors.\n\n2. Recognize that dividing 8 by 2 (obtained from 8 - 6) yields 4, a useful intermediate for reaching 24 via multiplication (e.g., 4 \u00d7 6 = 24).\n\n3. To generate 3, consider dividing 9 by 3, but since 3 isn't initially present, look for ways to produce 3 through subtraction or division involving the known numbers. For instance, dividing 9 by 3 is invalid unless 3 is explicitly formed, so instead, consider dividing 9 by 3 only if 3 is obtainable.\n\n4. Alternatively, combine ",

Moves that produce or leave totals like 16, 8, or 6 tend to divert from the goal or lead to dead ends; thus, such operations are less promising. Valid moves must use only the original numbers or their valid intermediate results without creating illegal states\u2014such as dividing by zero or introducing non-existent intermediate values. A move that results in an invalid operation, or that uses a number not present in the current set, should be disregarded, as it indicates an illegal step. Prioritize combining large"

Key tactics involve creating small, useful factors through valid operations, avoiding invalid steps like subtracting numbers not available or dropping numbers improperly. \n\nA crucial insight is to generate 2 and 3 from the initial set, as these serve as building blocks for 24. For example, subtract 6 from 8 to get 2 (8 - 6 = 2), which is valid and creates a useful factor. Then, dividing 8 by 2 yields 4 (8 \u00f7 2 = 4), a key intermediate since 4 \u00d7 6 = 24. \n\nAnother approach involves examining 9 and 7 for potential division or subtraction to produce 3. However, since 9 \u00f7 3 is only valid if 3 is already available, look for direct methods to produce 3\u2014such as subtracting 6 from 9 (9 - 6 = 3), which is valid, but only if 6 is still accessible without prior invalid steps. \n\nThe main takeaway is to carefully generate 2 and 3 via valid subtractions or divisions, then combine these",

Moves should combine available numbers without creating invalid states or involving illegal operations like division by zero or using nonexistent results. Prioritize operations that produce intermediate totals closer to 24, avoiding results like 8, 6, or 16, which divert from the goal."

Building these smaller numbers through valid operations simplifies subsequent steps. For example, subtract 6 from 8 to obtain 2 (8 - 6 = 2), which is legitimate and creates a crucial factor. Then, dividing 8 by 2 yields 4 (8 \u00f7 2 = 4), another useful intermediate. Combining 4 with 6 (4 \u00d7 6 = 24) completes the solution, but this requires careful step sequencing.\n\nAvoid invalid steps such as reusing numbers improperly or dropping numbers without proper operation. For instance, subtracting 6 from 9 to get 3 (9 - 6 = 3) is valid, but ensure subsequent steps use only the current set of numbers without reuse or omission. Focus on operations that produce 2 and 3 directly from the initial set:  \n- 8 - 6 = 2  \n- 9 - 6 = 3  \n\nOnce these are obtained, multiply or divide to reach 24. For example, after creating 2 and 3, multiply them (2 \u00d7 12) or combine with other factors to reach 24.\n\nAnother tactic is to utilize division or subtraction to produce 3 from 9 or 7, but only if the intermediate steps maintain the integrity of the remaining numbers. For example, dividing 9 by 3 (if 3 exists) or subtracting ",

Valid moves should produce intermediate totals that progressively approach 24, especially through addition and multiplication, which are most effective for this set. Avoid moves that involve invalid operations, such as dividing by zero, or that reuse numbers no longer available. Moves that result in totals like 8, 6, or 16 tend to divert from the goal unless they set up a straightforward path to 24. Crucially, each step must accurately reflect the current set of remaining numbers derived from prior valid operations; any move that re"

The recent analysis highlights the importance of strict adherence to number availability; avoid reusing or dropping numbers improperly.\n\nKey strategies:\n1. **Generate 2 and 3 from initial numbers:**  \n   - For 2: Use operations like 8 - 6 = 2 or 9 - 7 = 2.  \n   - For 3: Use operations like 9 - 6 = 3 or 7 - 4 (if available). Ensure these are derived from current remaining numbers without reusing used numbers.\n\n2. **Sequence operations carefully:**  \n   - After obtaining 2 and 3, multiply them directly: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24, but since 12 isn't directly available, look for ways to produce 12 (e.g., 6 \u00d7 2).  \n   - For example, from remaining numbers, get 4 (via 8 \u00f7 2) and then multiply with 6 to reach 24.\n\n3. **Avoid invalid steps:**  \n   - Do not reuse numbers once they've been used in previous steps.  \n   - Do not subtract or divide numbers that are no longer available after prior operations.\n\n4. **Construct solutions systematically:**  \n   - For instance, from the initial set, generate 2 (8 - 6) and 3 (9 - 6).  \n   - Use 8 - 6 = 2 (left: 2, 7, 9)  \n",

Valid operations primarily involve addition and multiplication to produce intermediate totals closer to 24, while subtraction and division should be used carefully to avoid overshooting or invalid moves. Crucially, each move must accurately reflect the current remaining numbers; using a number no longer available (e.g., reusing 9 after it's been eliminated) renders the move impossible. Effective steps generate intermediate values that facilitate a straightforward path to 24, such as combining 8 and 3 or 6 and 4, rather than producing totals like 8 or"

The recent analysis emphasizes strict adherence to the availability of each number; avoid reusing or dropping numbers improperly, and ensure all operations are valid and based solely on the current set of remaining numbers.\n\n**Key Strategic Insights:**\n\n1. **Generate Fundamental Factors (2 and 3):**  \n   Since 24 factors into 3 \u00d7 8 or 4 \u00d7 6, producing 2 and 3 early is advantageous.  \n   - To obtain 2: Use operations like 8 - 6 = 2 (valid, remaining numbers after this step: 2, 7, 9).  \n   - To obtain 3: Use 9 - 6 = 3 (valid, remaining numbers: 7, 8, 3). Alternatively, from 7 and 8, you can get 1 via subtraction (8 - 7 = 1), then multiply or divide to reach 2 or 3, but focus on direct methods first.\n\n2. **Construct 12 via Multiplication of 6 and 2:**  \n   - Once you have 2 (from 8 - 6), and 6 (initial), multiply: 6 \u00d7 2 = 12.  \n   - From 12, reach 24 by multiplying by 2, which can be obtained from remaining numbers or through division.\n\n3. **Use Remaining Numbers Effectively:**  \n   - After generating 2 and 3, combine them with other numbers to reach 24. For example,  \n     - 8 \u00f7 2 = 4, then 4 \u00d7 6 = 24.  \n     - Alternatively, from the initial numbers, get 4 via 8 \u00f7 2, then multiply",
                    "value_summary": "In the Game of 24 with 6, 7, 8, 9, effective moves are those that accurately combine available numbers to approach 24 through valid operations\u2014primarily addition and multiplication\u2014while respecting the current set without reusing or dropping original numbers improperly. Moves that produce intermediate totals closer to 24, such as combining 8 and 3 or 6 and 4, are promising, whereas moves that overshoot or produce invalid values hinder progress. Crucially, each step must only manipulate remaining numbers; using a number no longer in the set invalidates the move. For example, after combining 8 and 6 to get 14,"

The key is to create intermediate factors\u2014primarily 2 and 3\u2014using the available numbers, then combine these to reach 24. An effective approach involves leveraging the prime factorizations and direct operations to minimize complexity.\n\n**Step 1: Generate Fundamental Factors (2 and 3)**  \nStart by producing the basic factors that facilitate reaching 24.  \n- **Creating 2:**  \n  Use the difference between 8 and 6: **8 - 6 = 2**.  \n  This operation is valid and uses only the initial numbers, leaving 7 and 9 untouched.  \n- **Creating 3:**  \n  Use the difference between 9 and 6: **9 - 6 = 3**.  \n  Alternatively, subtract 7 from 8 to get 1, then multiply or divide to reach 3 if needed, but the direct difference is simplest.\n\n**Step 2: Build Toward 12 or 24**  \nOnce 2 and 3 are available, combine them with other numbers.  \n- **Form 12:**  \n  Multiply 6 (original) by 2 (from above): **6 \u00d7 2 = 12**.  \n  Alternatively, combine 3 with 4 (obtained from 8 \u00f7 2) to get 12 via multiplication (3 \u00d7 4).  \n- **Reach 24:**  \n  Recognize that 24 = 12 \u00d7 2 or 8 \u00d7 3.  \n  Use the 8 from the initial set, and the 3 from earlier, to get 24: **8 \u00d7 3 = 24**.  \n\n**Step 3: Use Remaining Numbers Effectively**  \n- After creating 2 and 3, consider operations with leftover numbers.  \n- For example, from 8 and 2: **8 \u00f7 2 = 4**, then multiply by 6 or ",

Moves that produce intermediate results closer to 24, such as combining 8 and 6 to form 14 or 7 and 9 to make 63 (which can be adjusted), are promising. However, any move that involves invalid operations\u2014like using a number that no longer exists in the current set or reusing numbers\u2014renders the move unpromising. For example, attempting to combine 8 and 3 is invalid if 3 isn't in the current set. The key is"

The key is to avoid reusing numbers improperly and to ensure each step strictly adheres to the rules of using only the remaining numbers exactly once.\n\n**Step 1: Generate Basic Factors (2 and 3)**  \nStart by creating essential factors that facilitate reaching 24:\n\n- **Creating 2:**  \n  Use the difference between 8 and 6: **8 - 6 = 2**.  \n  This operation is valid and uses only the original numbers, leaving 7 and 9 untouched. This gives a reliable way to generate 2 without complex manipulations.\n\n- **Creating 3:**  \n  Use the difference between 9 and 6: **9 - 6 = 3**.  \n  Alternatively, subtract 7 from 8 to get 1, then manipulate further, but direct differences are simpler and less error-prone.\n\n**Step 2: Build Toward 12 or 24 Using These Factors**  \nWith 2 and 3 in hand, combine them with the remaining numbers:\n\n- **Form 12:**  \n  Multiply 6 by 2: **6 \u00d7 2 = 12**.  \n  Alternatively, from the remaining numbers, multiply 3 by 4 (obtained from 8 \u00f7 2): **3 \u00d7 4 = 12**.  \n  These intermediate steps simplify the process of reaching 24.\n\n- **Reach 24:**  \n  Recognize that 24 is obtainable via multiplication of 8 and 3: **8 \u00d7 3 = 24**.  \n  Since both 8 and 3 are available from initial steps, this is the most straightforward approach.\n\n**Step 3: Use Remaining Numbers Effectively**  \nOnce 2 and 3 are generated, incorporate remaining numbers carefully:\n\n- For example, divide 8 by 2: **8 \u00f7 2 = 4**.  \n- Then, multiply 4 by 6 or 7 as needed to approach 24, always ensuring each number is used once and only within the current step.\n\n**Avoid Reusing or Dropping Numbers Improperly",

Moves that produce intermediate results closer to 24, such as multiplying 8 and 3 (if available) or adding 9 and 7, are promising when these combinations are valid within the current set. Conversely, moves that involve invalid operations\u2014like combining numbers no longer present or using a number more than once improperly\u2014are unpromising. For example, attempting to operate with a number that has already been used or that isn't in the current set (e.g., combining 8 with"

Past attempts highlight the importance of strict adherence to rules\u2014each number can only be used once per operation, and reuse or improper dropping of numbers invalidates the solution. The recent analysis underscores that while some steps may seem promising, they can be invalid if they reuse numbers or involve illegal operations.\n\n**Key Insights for the 6, 7, 8, 9 Puzzle:**\n\n1. **Generate Basic Factors Carefully:**  \n   The most reliable approach is to produce 2 and 3 directly from the original numbers through simple differences or divisions:\n\n   - To get **2**, use **8 - 6 = 2**.  \n   - To get **3**, use **9 - 6 = 3** or **8 - 5**, but since 5 isn't available, **9 - 6** is the most straightforward.  \n   \n   These operations utilize only the original numbers, leaving the others untouched, thus preserving options for later steps.\n\n2. **Construct 24 via Multiplication of Factors:**  \n   Once 2 and 3 are obtained, they can be combined with other numbers:\n\n   - Recognize that **8 \u00d7 3 = 24** is the most direct approach, since both 8 and 3 are accessible after initial steps.  \n   - Alternatively, multiplying 6 by 4 (which can be created via **8 \u00f7 2**) is feasible, but this introduces division, which must be carefully managed to avoid reusing numbers improperly.\n\n3. **Use Remaining Numbers Strategically:**  \n   After generating 2 and 3, incorporate the leftover numbers (7 and the remaining original numbers) to reach 24:\n\n   - For example, divide **8 \u00f7 2 = 4**, then multiply by 6 to reach 24 (**4 \u00d7 6 = 24**).  \n   - Or, multiply **3** by **8** directly if the sequence permits.  \n   \n   These steps should be executed only if the numbers involved are still available and haven't been used in previous steps.\n\n4. **",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves for the 6, 7, 8, 9 puzzle, promising steps are those that logically combine remaining numbers to edge closer to 24, using valid operations\u2014primarily addition and multiplication\u2014without reusing or invalidly manipulating numbers. Moves that reduce the set to intermediate results nearer to 24 (e.g., 8\u00d73=24 or 9+7=16) are promising if feasible within the current numbers. Conversely, moves that attempt to operate with numbers no longer present or involve invalid reuse are unpromising. For example, combining 8 and 9 is promising if it leads toward 24, but trying to combine a number already used or missing from the current set (like using 6 after it\u2019s been used) is unpromising. The recent attempt shows that after selecting a move, the remaining numbers should be carefully tracked; any move that"

Past attempts reveal that adherence to the rules\u2014each number used exactly once per operation\u2014is crucial; reusing or misapplying numbers invalidates solutions.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Generate Fundamental Factors from the Original Numbers**  \n   - **Create 2:** Use `8 - 6 = 2`. This operation utilizes only 8 and 6, leaving 7 and 9 untouched.  \n   - **Create 3:** Use `9 - 6 = 3`. This consumes 9 and 6, leaving 7 and 8 untouched.  \n   - Alternatively, `9 - 7 = 2` or `8 - 7 = 1` can be used if advantageous, but `8 - 6 = 2` and `9 - 6 = 3` are the most straightforward.\n\n2. **Construct 24 via Multiplication of Factors**  \n   - Once 2 and 3 are established, multiply them to get 6: `2 \u00d7 3 = 6`.  \n   - Combine this with other remaining numbers (7 or 8) to reach 24.  \n   - The most direct approach is to multiply 8 by 3: `8 \u00d7 3 = 24`.  \n     - This requires creating 3 first, which can be done via `9 - 6 = 3`.  \n     - Use `8 \u00d7 3 = 24`, leaving 7 unused, which can be used in other steps if needed.\n\n3. **Leverage Remaining Numbers Strategically**  \n   - If you have created 6 (via `2 \u00d7 3`), then multiply by 4 (which can be obtained via `8 \u00f7 2`):  \n     - From earlier, `8 \u00f7 2 = 4`.  \n     - To do this, ensure 2 is available (from `8 - 6`) and that 8 is still unused.  \n     - Then, `4 \u00d7 6 = 24`.  \n   - Alternatively, after generating 3, use `8 \u00d7 3 = 24` directly, which is simpler.\n\n4.",

Effective moves produce intermediate results closer to 24, such as 8\u00d73=24 or 9+7=16, provided the necessary components are available. Moves that rely on numbers no longer present or involve reuse of previously used numbers are unpromising. Careful tracking of remaining numbers after each step is essential; invalid moves\u2014such as attempting to operate with numbers already eliminated\u2014should be avoided. Moves should"

These foundational factors enable combinations that reach 24 efficiently. The most reliable methods involve creating 2 and 3 first, then multiplying these to approach 24.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Generate Fundamental Factors Correctly:**  \n   - To create **2**, use `8 - 6 = 2` (valid, as both 8 and 6 are original numbers).  \n   - To create **3**, use `9 - 6 = 3` or `9 - 7 = 2`; if you need 3 specifically, prefer `9 - 6`.  \n   - Avoid operations that introduce numbers not present initially (e.g., dividing 8 by 2 unless 2 is explicitly created).\n\n2. **Construct 24 by Combining Factors:**  \n   - Once 2 and 3 are established, multiply them: `2 \u00d7 3 = 6`.  \n   - From that, multiply by remaining numbers to reach 24. For example, `8 \u00d7 3 = 24`, which is straightforward once 3 is available.  \n   - Alternatively, after creating 6, multiply by 4 (which can be obtained via `8 \u00f7 2`), then `4 \u00d7 6 = 24`.\n\n3. **Sequence of Operations for Efficiency:**  \n   - Use operations that consume numbers without leaving leftovers that can't be combined.  \n   - For instance, generate 3 with `9 - 6`, then multiply with 8: `8 \u00d7 3 = 24`.  \n   - If needed, utilize `8 - 6` to get",

By establishing these core factors, you can efficiently combine them through multiplication to reach 24. Past attempts and feedback highlight the importance of preserving the integrity of the number set at each step and avoiding any operations that introduce or rely on non-existent intermediate values.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Generate Fundamental Factors Correctly and Legally:**\n   - **Creating 2:** Use `8 - 6 = 2`. Both 8 and 6 are original numbers, so this is valid. Alternative ways include `14 / 7 = 2` (if 14 is available), but with 6,7,8,9, this is the most straightforward.\n   - **Creating 3:** Use `9 - 6 = 3`, which directly yields 3 from the original numbers. Avoid dividing 8 or 7 unless they produce 3 directly, which is not possible here.\n   - **Avoid using intermediate results that are not in the current number set:** For example, if you have already used 9 and 6, you cannot reuse them unless the operation explicitly returns to that number.\n\n2. **Construct 24 by Combining Established Factors:**\n   - Once 2 and 3 are created, multiply them: `2 \u00d7 3 = 6`. This intermediate is useful for building toward 24.\n   - Recognize that 24 can be obtained by multiplying 8 and 3 directly: `8 \u00d7 3 = 24`. Given that 3 can be created as above, this is often the most straightforward route.\n   - Alternatively, after creating 6, multiply by remaining numbers to reach 24, for example, `6 \u00d7 4`. To get 4, divide `8 \u00f7 2` (using the earlier created 2), which is valid if 2 is available.\n\n3. **Sequence of Operations for Efficiency:**\n   - Use operations that consume the current set of numbers entirely or leave only useful residues. For instance, starting with `9 - 6 = 3",

For example, combining 8 and 7 via addition (8 + 7 = 15) or multiplication (8 \u00d7 3) can be promising if they lead to manageable paths toward 24. Conversely, moves that rely on numbers no longer available or that involve invalid reuse\u2014such as attempting to operate on a number already used or not present in the current set\u2014are unpromising (\"impossible\").

Once these key factors are established, combining them efficiently through multiplication allows for the straightforward achievement of 24. Past attempts and feedback emphasize the importance of strict adherence to the rule that each original number can only be used once, and that intermediate results must be derived directly from the original set without reusing or reintroducing discarded values.\n\n**Key Insights for the Current Set:**\n\n1. **Generate the Essential Factors (2 and 3):**  \n   - **Creating 2:**  \n     The most direct way to generate 2 from the given numbers is `8 - 6 = 2`. Both 8 and 6 are part of the original set, making this operation valid. Alternatively, dividing a sum that yields 14 by 7 (`14 / 7 = 2`) is possible if 14 is obtainable, but with 6, 7, 8, 9, the subtraction route remains the simplest.  \n   - **Creating 3:**  \n     From the original numbers, `9 - 6 = 3` is the most straightforward. It uses only available numbers, preserving the set's integrity. Attempting to generate 3 via division involving 8 or 7 is less direct and often less efficient.\n\n2. **Avoid Reusing or Reintroducing Numbers:**  \n   - Once a number like 6 has been used in a subtraction to produce 3, it cannot be reused unless explicitly restored by a valid operation, which is typically not possible without violating rules.  \n   - Be cautious that subsequent operations only involve remaining numbers or previously derived results that are still valid and unused.\n\n3. **Construct 24 by Combining the Factors:**  \n   - The primary route is to leverage the foundational factors:  \n     - `2` and `3`, which can be multiplied to get 6, or combined with other numbers for a direct route to 24.  \n     - Recognize that `8 \u00d7 3 = 24` is an immediate solution once 3 is created, making this the most efficient route.  \n   - Alternatively, after generating 2 and 3 separately, multiplying them (`2 \u00d7 3 = 6`) and then combining with other numbers (like multiplying by 4, which can be obtained via `8 \u00f7 2`) is valid, provided that 2 and 8 are correctly established.\n\n4. **Sequence of Operations for",
                    "value_summary": "In the 6, 7, 8, 9 puzzle, effective moves are those that combine available numbers through valid operations\u2014primarily addition and multiplication\u2014to systematically progress toward 24. Moves should prioritize combining larger or strategically valuable pairs that reduce the problem size while maintaining multiple pathways to reach 24. For example, adding 8 + 7 = 15 or multiplying 8 \u00d7 3 (if 3 is available) can be promising, provided they do not eliminate critical options or violate rules. Conversely, moves that attempt to operate on numbers no longer present, reuse eliminated numbers, or produce intermediate results that cannot logically lead to 24 are unpromising (\"impossible\"). When only two numbers remain, their ability to combine directly into 24 determines the move's promise. The current remaining set\u2014such as 8, 3, 9\u2014should be evaluated for feasibility: if operations on these numbers cannot produce 24 or lead to a solvable path, the move is considered impossible.

This approach minimizes guesswork and ensures adherence to the rule that each number is used exactly once.\n\n**1. Generate the Key Factors (2 and 3):**  \n- **Creating 3:**  \n  The simplest way is `9 - 6 = 3`. Both 9 and 6 are in the original set, and this subtraction is valid. Using this approach avoids complex operations and preserves the remaining numbers for future steps.  \n- **Creating 2:**  \n  From 8 and 6, `8 - 6 = 2`. This subtraction directly yields 2, which is crucial for constructing 24 through multiplication. Alternatively, dividing 6 by 3 is invalid here because 3 hasn't been created yet; thus, subtraction is the most straightforward.\n\n**2. Preserve the Integrity of the Original Numbers:**  \n- Once a number is used in a calculation, it cannot be reused unless explicitly reintroduced through valid operations, which is generally not permitted.  \n- After creating 3 (from `9 - 6`), the remaining numbers are 8, 7, and 9; after creating 2 (from `8 - 6`), the remaining numbers are 7, 9, and 3. Be mindful to only use these remaining numbers in subsequent steps to avoid invalid reuse.\n\n**3. Construct 24 by Combining Factors:**  \n- Once 3 and 2 are established, the most direct route to 24 is via multiplication:  \n  - `8 \u00d7 3 = 24` if 8 and 3 are available.  \n  - Alternatively, generate 4 from `8 \u00f7 2`, then multiply by 6 or 4 to reach 24, but this involves more steps and complexity.  \n",
                    "value_summary": "In the 6, 7, 8, 9 puzzle, effective moves are those that strategically combine available numbers via addition or multiplication to systematically progress toward 24 while preserving multiple pathways. Valid moves reduce the problem size without eliminating critical options or violating rules\u2014such as reusing numbers or operating on non-existent values. Prioritize pairing larger or strategically valuable numbers, for example, combining 8 and 7 to create 15 or multiplying 8 \u00d7 3 if 3 is available. Moves that produce intermediate results incapable of leading to 24 are unpromising (\"impossible\"). When only two numbers remain, their direct combination into 24 determines move viability; if impossible, backtracking is necessary. \n\nFor the specific set 6, 7, 8, 9, focus on identifying combinations that either reach intermediate targets conducive to forming 24 or reduce options to manageable pairs. Operations involving numbers no longer present or that violate previous steps are invalid. The recent learning"

Past attempts reveal that straightforward, minimal-step methods tend to be more reliable than complex sequences.\n\n**1. Focus on Creating the Fundamental Factors 2 and 3 First**\n\n- **Generating 3:**  \n  The simplest way is `9 - 6 = 3`. Both 9 and 6 are available initially, and subtraction here is direct and valid. This operation uses two original numbers, leaving 7 and 8 untouched.  \n  **Remaining numbers:** 7, 8, 3\n\n- **Generating 2:**  \n  From 8 and 6, `8 - 6 = 2` is tempting, but 6 has already been used in creating 3, so unless you can reuse numbers (which you cannot), this isn't valid. Alternatively, consider `8 - 7 = 1`, but that doesn't directly help unless you build up to 2 via multiplication or division.  \n  Another way is to use `8 / 4` if 4 were available, but it's not.  \n  Since 8 and 6 are used for 3, and 8 and 7 do not produce 2 directly, the best bet is to create 2 from other operations involving remaining numbers.\n\n- **Alternative methods for 2:**  \n  If you haven't yet created 3, you can create 3 from `9 - 6`. Then, with 7 and 8 remaining, try to generate 2 via division: `8 / 4`, but 4 isn't in the set, so that\u2019s invalid.  \n  Alternatively, from 8 and 7, `8 - 7 = 1`, then `1 + 1 = 2` if you could produce 1 twice, but that complicates matters. The cleanest method remains to generate 3 first, then focus on forming 2.\n\n**2. Use Created Factors to Reach 24**\n\nOnce you have 3 and 2, multiplying them with remaining numbers can produce 24 efficiently:\n\n- **Multiply 3 and 8:**  \n  `3 * 8 = 24`  \n  This is perfect if 3 and 8 are available after previous steps.\n\n- **Step-by-step example:**\n\n  **Step 1:** `9 - 6 = 3` (remaining: 7, 8, 3)  \n  **Step 2:** `8 - 7 = 1` (remaining: 1, 3)  \n  **Step 3:** `3 * 8 = 24`?

                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 6, 7, 8, 9 puzzle, it is essential to focus on moves that strategically progress toward 24 while maintaining valid game states. Effective moves are those that combine available numbers through addition or multiplication to generate intermediate targets conducive to reaching 24. These moves should reduce the problem size without eliminating critical options or violating rules\u2014such as reusing numbers or operating on non-existent values. Prioritize pairing larger or strategically valuable numbers, like combining 8 and 7 to produce 15 or multiplying 8 \u00d7 3 if 3 is accessible. Moves that produce intermediate results incapable of leading to 24 are unpromising (\"impossible\") and should be avoided, as they do not advance the solution.\n\nWhen only two numbers remain, their direct combination into 24 determines move viability; if impossible, backtracking is required. Moving forward, assess whether the intermediate results can still lead to 24 through subsequent valid operations. Operations involving numbers no longer present or inconsistent with previous steps violate rules and invalidate the move. It\u2019s critical to track the remaining numbers after each move, ensuring that each step is legal and preserves multiple pathways toward 24.\n\nRecent learnings highlight the importance of verifying move legality\u2014such as"

Past attempts highlight that immediate, minimal-step solutions tend to be more reliable than complex sequences. Here\u2019s an optimized, targeted approach based on the latest insights:\n\n1. **Create the factor 3 early using subtraction:**  \n   The simplest and most direct method is `9 - 6 = 3`. Both 9 and 6 are original numbers, and this subtraction is valid, using only available numbers. After this operation, remaining numbers are 7, 8, and the newly created 3.\n\n2. **Generate the factor 2 from remaining numbers:**  \n   With 8 and 7 still available, consider operations that produce 2.  \n   - From `8 - 7 = 1`, you get 1, which is useful for building 2 via addition (`1 + 1 = 2`), but that requires creating another 1, which isn't directly available.  \n   - Alternatively, from `8 / 4` is invalid because 4 isn't in the set.  \n   - Another approach is to create 2 directly from 8 and 6, but since 6 has been used in creating 3, reuse isn't permissible.  \n   \n   Therefore, the most straightforward method is to generate 3 first, then attempt to produce 2 from the remaining numbers, keeping in mind that multiple operations or reusing numbers is invalid.\n\n3. **Combine the created factors to reach 24:**  \n   Once you have 3 and 2, multiply them with remaining numbers for a quick route to 24.  \n   - For example, `3 * 8 = 24` is an ideal solution if 3 and 8 are both available after prior steps.  \n   - Alternatively, multiplying `2 * 12` if 12 can",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 6, 7, 8, 9 puzzle, it is crucial to prioritize moves that effectively reduce the problem toward the target of 24 while maintaining valid game states. Moves should involve combining available numbers through addition or multiplication to generate intermediate results that facilitate reaching 24. For example, pairing larger numbers like 8 and 7 to produce 15, or multiplying 8 by 3 if accessible, can be promising strategies. The goal is to generate intermediate values that can be further manipulated toward 24, avoiding dead-end results that cannot lead to the target.\n\nA key principle is to ensure move legality: every operation must operate on numbers currently available and not reuse or alter numbers that have been eliminated or are no longer in play. After each move, carefully track the remaining numbers. Any move that attempts to use a number not present, or that violates rules (such as reusing a number or operating on invalid values), is invalid and should be discarded. For instance, in the recent attempt, performing 8 - 7 = 1 is valid, leaving remaining numbers 1, 9, 6. However, subsequent steps based on incorrect assumptions or reusing numbers lead to illegal states, invalidating the move.\n\nWhen only two numbers remain, the move's viability hinges on whether their direct combination yields 24. If impossible, backtracking is necessary, exploring alternative pairings. Throughout, focus on moves"

Key insights from recent attempts show that immediate, minimal-step solutions are most reliable, and operations should reduce the set size systematically.\n\n1. **Generate the factor 3 early:**  \n   Use `9 - 6 = 3`. This operation is direct, uses only the original numbers, and reduces complexity. Now, remaining numbers are 7, 8, and the new 3.\n\n2. **Create the factor 2 efficiently:**  \n   From `8 - 6 = 2` is invalid since 6 was used, and 8-7=1 doesn't directly give 2.  \n   Alternatively, from the remaining set, `8 - 7 = 1`, which can help in later steps, but not directly for 2.  \n   Since 8 and 9 are available, consider `8 / 4`\u2014but 4 isn't in the set.  \n   The simplest approach is to produce 2 from 8 and 6, but since 6 was used, options are limited.  \n   Therefore, focus on creating 2 from 8 and 7 indirectly:  \n   - `8 - 7 = 1`  \n   - then `1 + 1 = 2`, but creating a second 1 requires additional steps, which may not be optimal",

Valid moves involve combining available numbers through addition or multiplication to produce intermediate results that can be further manipulated. For example, pairing 8 and 7 to make 15 or multiplying 8 by 3 (if possible) are promising strategies, as they generate intermediate values closer to 24. The focus should be on creating intermediate results that facilitate reaching 24, while avoiding dead-ends\u2014situations where remaining numbers cannot produce 24 through legal operations.\n\nLegal move evaluation hinges on strict adherence to operation rules: each operation must involve only the numbers currently available, without reusing or altering numbers that are no longer in play. After each move, the remaining numbers should be accurately tracked; any step that attempts to operate on invalid or nonexistent numbers is invalid. For instance, subtracting 7 from 8 to get 1 is valid if both are available, but subsequent steps must correctly reflect the new set of numbers. When only two numbers remain,"

Start by exploring operations involving 13, as it can be combined with smaller numbers to approach 24 efficiently. For example, consider subtracting or dividing 13 to get manageable intermediate results.\n\nNext, examine the two 4s. Combining them with addition or multiplication can produce 8 or 16, which are closer to 24 when combined with other results. For instance, 4 + 4 = 8 is a straightforward step; then, multiplying 8 by 3 yields 24 directly, but this requires using all numbers in a sequence that respects the original set.\n\nA key insight is to utilize subtraction or division to generate intermediate values that facilitate reaching 24. For example, subtracting 3 from 13 yields 10, which, when multiplied by 2 (if the remaining 4s are combined appropriately), can approach 24. Alternatively, dividing 13 by 4 results in a non-integer (3.25), which doesn\u2019t help directly, so focus on operations that produce integers.\n\nGiven the original set, a promising approach is:\n\n1. Use the two 4s:\n   - 4 + 4 = 8\n2. Combine 8 with 3:\n   - 8 + 3 = 11\n3. Use 13 in a way to reach 24:\n   - 13 - 11 = ",

Focus on operations involving 13 that produce manageable intermediate results\u2014subtraction and division are particularly useful because they often yield smaller, more workable numbers. For instance, subtracting 4 from 13 yields 9, a convenient starting point.\n\nNext, utilize the two 4s to generate key intermediate values. Combining them via addition gives 8 (4 + 4), which can be directly multiplied by 3 to reach 24 (8 \u00d7 3). Alternatively, adding the 4s and then combining with 3 or 13 to approach 24 can be effective. For example, adding the 4s to get 8, then adding or multiplying with 3 or 13 after appropriate adjustments, can lead toward the target.\n\nCrucially, avoid operations that involve numbers not present in the current set. For example, after subtracting 4 from 13 to get 9, the set becomes {9, 3, 4}. From here, consider combining 9 and 3 via multiplication (9 \u00d7 3 = 27) and then adjusting with the remaining 4, or look for ways to reach 24 directly. For instance, 9 + 4 = 13, which doesn't help directly, but 9 - 3 = 6, and then multiplying 6 by ",

Moves that generate intermediate totals aligned with standard targets (like 24) and preserve all original numbers are promising; for example, subtracting 4 from 13 to get 9 keeps a flexible set (9, 3, 4) for further combination.

Combining the two 4s early\u2014adding them to make 8\u2014is also advantageous, as 8 is directly related to 24 through multiplication (8 \u00d7 3 = 24).\n\nGiven the previous successful step of adding the two 4s to get 8, subsequent moves should incorporate this result. For example, multiplying 8 by 3 achieves 24 directly. To incorporate the remaining numbers, look for ways to generate 3 or 24 through combinations involving 13 and 9. For instance, after obtaining 9 (by subtracting 4 from 13), multiplying it by 2 (which can be formed by adding the two 4s and then dividing appropriately) leads toward the target.\n\nAvoid operations that reuse numbers improperly or that involve invalid combinations\u2014such as attempting to use a number not present after a previous operation's step.

Moves that generate intermediate totals aligning with standard goals\u2014such as creating 8, 9, or 12\u2014are promising, especially if they preserve the original numbers or produce new, usable sums. For example, combining 4 + 4 = 8 yields a flexible set (3, 8, 13) for subsequent steps, facilitating progress toward 24. Conversely, steps that produce totals not present in the current set or that reuse numbers improperly are less promising; they risk invalid moves or dead-ends. \n\nFrom recent learning, it\u2019s clear that adhering strictly to the rules\u2014using each number exactly once per move and only combining available numbers\u2014is crucial. For instance, after forming 8 from 4 + 4, subsequent valid operations should focus on pairing remaining numbers to reach 24, such as multiplying 8 by 3. Moves that attempt to combine 13 with others to reach 24 should be scrutinized for legality; using 13 alone or"

The previous attempt correctly identified that subtracting 4 from 13 yields 9, resulting in the remaining numbers 3 and 9. This is a solid initial move, as creating smaller, flexible values simplifies subsequent operations.\n\nHowever, from the state {3, 9}, there is no straightforward way to reach 24 in a single step. The key insight is that after obtaining 9, neither multiplying nor adding 3 and 9 directly produces 24 (since 3\u00d79=27, 3+9=12). Dividing or subtracting from these values also does not produce 24 directly. Therefore, the main strategy should pivot toward generating intermediate targets like 8 or 12, which are closer to 24 through simple multiplication or addition.\n\nGiven the original numbers, an effective approach is to combine the two 4s early, since 4+4=8. Multiplying this 8 by 3 yields 24 directly (8\u00d73=24). To implement this, the steps are:\n\n1. Combine the two 4s: 4 + 4 = 8.\n2. Use the remaining 13 and 3 to produce a factor of 3 or 8, or to manipulate 13 for a suitable operation.\n\nThe challenge lies in integrating 13 with the other numbers to produce 3 or 8:\n\n- From 13, subtract 9 (which is 13 - 4 - 4 or 13 - (4 +",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves for the set 3, 4, 4, 13, the core principle is to select operations that systematically reduce complexity while maintaining legal, achievable intermediate states toward the goal of 24. Moves that produce intermediate totals aligning with common target components\u2014such as 8, 9, or 12\u2014are often promising, as they facilitate subsequent steps. For example, combining 4 + 4 = 8 creates a flexible set (3, 8, 13), enabling straightforward progress via multiplication or addition toward 24. The key is to generate intermediate values that can logically lead to 24 with minimal steps, avoiding dead-ends.\n\nRecent learning emphasizes strict adherence to game rules: each number must be used exactly once per move, and no intermediate totals should be invalid or impossible given the current set. Moves that produce totals not present in the current set, or that reuse or drop numbers improperly, are less promising. For instance, combining 13 with another number must be carefully considered\u2014if the move produces a total not in the current set or involves reusing a number, it is invalid.\n\nSpecifically, when considering operations like 13 - 4 = 9, it\u2019s vital to verify that the resulting set after the move contains only the remaining numbers, with no drops or duplications. If a move leads to an intermediate state where the remaining numbers are inconsistent with the previous step, or if it involves reusing numbers improperly, it"

A key insight is to combine the two 4s first: 4 + 4 = 8, which simplifies subsequent multiplication steps to reach 24 directly via 8\u00d73. \n\nGiven the challenge of integrating 13, consider operations that generate manageable intermediate targets. Since subtracting 4 from 13 yields 9 (13 - 4 = 9), it\u2019s tempting to use this, but the previous attempt reveals that subtracting 4 from 13 is valid, yet subsequent steps to reach 24 are complex. The main goal is to avoid invalid operations, such as reusing numbers improperly or performing illegal steps like subtracting from a number already used.\n\nInstead, prioritize creating 8 or 12 from the available numbers, as these are closer to 24 when multiplied or added. For example, combining the two 4s to get 8, then multiplying by 3 yields 24 directly. To incorporate 13, look for operations that produce 3 or 4, or manipulate 13 to generate a 1 or 3. For",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 24 game for the set 3, 4, 4, 13, it is essential to develop a nuanced and systematic approach that balances logical operation selection with strict adherence to game rules. The core principle remains: select operations that reduce the problem\u2019s complexity while preserving the potential to reach 24 efficiently. Recent insights reinforce the importance of generating intermediate values that are both achievable and conducive to subsequent steps, emphasizing the need for intermediate totals that align with common factors or facilitate straightforward combinations.\n\nFirst, moves should aim to produce intermediate totals that are present within the current set or are easily combinable with remaining numbers. For example, combining two 4s to produce 8 (via addition) creates a versatile new number that can be multiplied or added to reach 24. Similarly, operations like 13 - 4 = 9 are promising because 9 is a manageable number that can be combined with others to approach 24, provided the operation is valid and the resulting set remains consistent with the rules.\n\nSecond, it is crucial to verify the legality of each move rigorously. Every operation must use exactly two numbers from the current set, producing a new number that replaces those two in the set. No numbers can be reused or dropped arbitrarily. Moves that involve combining numbers not present in the current set, or that produce results inconsistent with the remaining numbers, are invalid. For instance, attempting to do 9 - 4 = 5 after obtaining 9 from 13 - 4 is valid only if the previous step was legal and the set correctly updated; any deviation indicates a mistake.\n\nThird, the evaluation model must incorporate the state of remaining numbers after each move. After performing an operation, the set updates by removing the used numbers and adding the new result. Moves should be judged based on how they transform this set\u2014whether they open pathways toward 24 or lead to dead-ends. For example, combining 4 + 4 = 8 is promising because it yields a flexible number that can be multiplied by another to reach 24, such as 8 * 3. Conversely, moves that produce totals not aligning with the remaining numbers or that create dead-end sets should be deprioritized.\n\nFourth, recent learning emphasizes that moves leading to invalid intermediate states\u2014such as producing totals not present in the current set or involving improper reuse"

This approach simplifies the problem by reducing complexity and leveraging straightforward operations.\n\nGiven the presence of 13, a strategic move is to generate manageable intermediate values that bring you closer to 24. Subtracting 4 from 13 yields 9 (13-4=9), which is a promising step because 9 is near 8 or 12, both of which can be combined with remaining numbers to reach 24.

Focus first on combining the two 4s to create a reliable, manageable number\u2014preferably 8\u2014since multiplying 8 by 3 yields 24 directly. This is often the most straightforward route: (4 + 4) = 8, then 8 \u00d7 3 = 24, giving an immediate solution if 3 and the combined 8 are available.\n\nHowever, the presence of 13 introduces complexity. A strategic alternative is to manipulate 13 to generate a close intermediate. For example, subtract 4 from 13: (13 - 4) = 9. This leaves you with numbers 3, 4, and 9, which can be combined further. But be cautious\u2014any subsequent operations must only involve the remaining numbers without reusing or reordering digits improperly.\n\nFrom recent attempts, a promising approach is:\n1. Use the two 4s early: (4 + 4) = 8.\n2. Use 8 and 3 to reach 24: 8 \u00d7 3 = 24.  \nThis requires generating 3 from the remaining numbers. Currently, 3 is directly available, so the solution is: (4 + 4) \u00d7 3 = 24. The remaining number 13 is unused, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, manipulating 13 can help:\n",
                    "value_summary": "Updated Evaluation Model for the 24 Game with Numbers 3, 4, 4, 13\n\nThis refined framework integrates previous insights and recent learning to optimize move selection when working with the numbers 3, 4, 4, and 13. It emphasizes generating intermediate values that facilitate reaching 24, executing valid operations, and maintaining flexible states for subsequent moves.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Goal-Enhancing Intermediate Results:**  \n   Focus on operations that produce intermediate totals conducive to reaching 24. For instance, combining the two 4s to get 8 is highly advantageous because multiplying 8 by 3 yields 24. Similarly, creating 9 via 13 - 4 provides a promising stepping stone if subsequent moves can leverage this total effectively.\n\n2. **Adhere Strictly to Valid Operations and State Updates:**  \n   Every move must be legal: use exactly two remaining numbers, apply one of the four basic operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7), and update the set correctly. Moves that reuse numbers improperly or produce totals inconsistent with current values are invalid. For example, combining 13 and 4 to get 17 is valid if both are available, but attempting to reuse a number or produce an invalid total violates rules.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Remaining Set After Each Move:**  \n   After executing a move, reassess the current set for feasibility. Moves should aim to reduce the set's complexity while preserving options to reach 24. For example:\n   - Combining 4 + 4 = 8 creates a versatile number that can be multiplied by 3 (from the remaining 13) or combined"

Combining the two 4s to get 8 is especially promising because multiplying 8 by 3 yields 24 directly. Similarly, creating 9 via 13 - 4 offers an alternative route if subsequent moves can leverage this total effectively.\n\n2. **Ensure Valid Operations and Proper State Updates:**  \n   Every move must be legal: select exactly two available numbers, apply one of +, \u2212, \u00d7, or \u00f7, and update the set precisely. Moves attempting to reuse numbers or produce totals inconsistent with current values are invalid. For example, combining 13"

Combining insights from previous attempts and recent learnings, here is a focused, actionable strategy tailored specifically for this set:\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining the Two 4s First:**\n   - The two 4s can be combined straightforwardly via addition: \\(4 + 4 = 8\\).\n   - This step reduces complexity, providing a reliable intermediate (8) that can be multiplied by 3 to reach 24.\n   - The sequence: \\((4 + 4) \\times 3 = 8 \\times 3 = 24\\) is the most direct and efficient solution.\n\n2. **Leverage the Remaining Numbers Post-Combination:**\n   - After forming 8 from the 4s, the remaining numbers are 3 and 13.\n   - The main challenge is incorporating 13 into the solution, as it doesn't naturally fit into simple operations to reach 24.\n   - Consider operations involving 13 to produce manageable intermediate values:\n     - \\(13 - 3 = 10\\)\n     - \\(13 - 4 = 9\\)\n     - \\(13 / 13 = 1\\)\n\n3. **Utilize the Large Number 13 Wisely:**\n   - Since 13 is large and not immediately conducive to producing 24 via simple operations, focus on transforming it into a value that, combined with other numbers, reaches 24.\n   - For example:\n     - Using \\(13 - 4 = 9\\), then see if 9 can be combined with remaining numbers.\n     - Or, using \\(13 - 3 = 10\\), and then manipulating 10 to approach 24.\n\n4. **Formulating a Solution Path:**\n   - The simplest path remains to focus on the two 4s first:\n     - \\(\\boxed{(4 + 4) \\times 3 = 24}\\)\n   - This uses only three numbers, leaving 13 unused, which is acceptable as long as all four numbers are used exactly once.  \n   - Since the game requires all numbers to be used exactly once, the above is not valid unless 13 is incorporated somehow.\n\n5. **Incorporate 13 into",

Creating 8 by combining the two 4s (4 + 4 = 8) is highly promising, as multiplying 8 by 3 yields 24 directly (8 \u00d7 3 = 24). Alternatively, generating 9 via 13 - 4 provides an auxiliary route, but only if subsequent steps can leverage this total effectively.\n\n2. **Legality and Validity of Moves:**  \n   Every move must be performed on two current, available numbers, applying one of +, \u2212, \u00d7, or \u00f7, resulting in a new set of numbers that replaces the used pair. Moves attempting to reuse a number or produce a total inconsistent with the current set are invalid. For example, subtracting 4 from 13 to get"

Creating 8 by combining the two 4s (4 + 4 = 8) is highly promising since multiplying 8 by 3 yields 24 directly (8 \u00d7 3 = 24). Similarly, generating 9 through 13 - 4 provides an alternative route, but only if subsequent steps can leverage this total effectively.\n\n2. **Move Legality and State Validity:**  \n   Every operation must be performed on two available, current numbers, adhering strictly to permitted operations (+, \u2212, \u00d7, \u00f7). Moves that reuse numbers improperly, produce invalid totals, or alter the set incorrectly are deemed invalid. For example, subtracting 4 from 13 to get 9 is valid, but subsequent"

For instance:  \n   - \\[13 - 4 = 9\\]  \n   - \\[13 - 3 = 10\\]  \n   - \\[13 / 13 = 1\\]  \n   \n   These can help bridge the gap toward 24 when combined with other operations.\n\n3. **Attempt to create 24 using the intermediate numbers:**  \n   After combining the 4s, the typical approach is to multiply the 8 by 3:  \n   \\[(8 \\times 3) = 24\\]  \n   But this uses only three numbers and neglects 13, which violates the rule to use all four numbers exactly once.  \n   \n   Alternatively, think about integrating 13 into the calculation without bypassing it. For example:  \n   - Use 13 in subtraction or division to generate a smaller or more convenient number:  \n     \\[13 - 4 = 9\\] or \\[13 - 3 = 10\\], then see if combining with the remaining numbers leads to 24.\n\n4. **Utilize the initial subtraction of 13 for strategic advantage:**  \n   From previous attempts, subtracting 4 from 13 yields 9, and subtracting 3 yields 10.  \n   For example:  \n   - \\[13 - 4 = 9\\] (remaining: 3, 4)  \n   - Or \\[13 - 3 = 10\\] (",

For this set, the straightforward solution is to add the two 4s to get 8, then combine this with 13 and 3 to reach 24 via simple addition: \\[(4 + 4) + 13 + 3 = 8 + 13 + 3 = 24\\]. This method ensures all four original numbers are used exactly once, adhering to game rules, and avoids overly complicated operations.\n\nRecent attempts revealed common pitfalls: misusing the remaining numbers, such as attempting to create new values not present in the current step, or reusing numbers improperly. For example, adding 13 + 4 to get 17, then trying to proceed with 3 and 17 is invalid because 17 didn't exist as a leftover in the prior step\u2014this highlights the importance of operating only on the current set of remaining numbers without introducing new intermediate values out of sequence.\n\nFrom the detailed analysis of possible operations, the key is to recognize valid combinations that use all four numbers exactly once.

Building on previous insights and recent learnings, here is a refined, focused approach:\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining the Two 4s Early:**  \n   Merging the two 4s into 8 simplifies the set, reducing complexity and providing a flexible base for further operations. For example, \\((4 + 4) = 8\\) creates an intermediate that can be combined with other numbers to reach 24.\n\n2. **Use the Simplified Set Effectively:**  \n   Once you have 8, consider how the remaining numbers (3 and 13) can combine with it. The goal is to reach 24 by adding or multiplying these intermediates. For instance, \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\), but since 13 is still available, explore if combining 13 with 8 or 3 yields a straightforward path.\n\n3. **Avoid Reusing or Creating Invalid Intermediate Values:**  \n   Recent attempts highlight the importance of operating only on the current set of remaining numbers. For example, after calculating \\(13 - 4 = 9\\), the subsequent step must involve only the remaining numbers 3, 4, and 9, without reusing or re-deriving values out of sequence.\n\n4. **Leverage Subtraction and Division for Manageable Intermediates:**  \n   Operations like \\(13 - 4 = 9\\) can simplify the problem, but subsequent steps must be valid. For example, from 9, adding 3 yields 12, which can then be multiplied by 2 (if available) or combined with other numbers to reach 24.\n\n5. **Validate Each Step for Legality and Consistency:**  \n   Every operation must be performed on the current",

Building on prior insights and recent learnings, the following refined approach is essential:\n\n1. **Prioritize Combining the Two 4s Early:**  \n   Merging the two 4s into 8 simplifies the set and provides a flexible intermediate. For example, \\((4 + 4) = 8\\) reduces complexity and offers multiple pathways toward 24, especially when combined with other numbers via multiplication or addition.\n\n2. **Focus on Operations Involving 13 and 3 with the Simplified Set:**  \n   After forming 8, examine how 13 and 3 can interact with it. Since 13 is close to 12, consider operations that bring the total near 24, such as subtracting 1 (via \\(13 - 12\\)), or multiplying 8 by 3 to reach 24 directly. For instance, \\(8 \\times 3 = 24\\) is a straightforward solution if the set permits.\n\n3. **Use Subtraction and Division to Create Manageable Intermediates:**  \n   When direct multiplication isn't feasible, explore subtracting or dividing to generate intermediate values that facilitate reaching 24. For example, \\(13 - 4 = 9\\) simplifies the problem, but subsequent steps must be valid and consistent with remaining numbers.\n\n4. **Avoid Reusing or Recreating Invalid Intermediates:**  \n   Every step must be performed strictly on the current set of remaining numbers, without reusing previous results out of sequence. For example, after combining 4 and ",

Building from previous learnings and recent validation, the key insights are:\n\n1. **Early Pairing of the Two 4s:**  \n   Combining the two 4s into 8 via \\((4 + 4) = 8\\) remains a foundational step. This simplifies the set to 3, 8, and 13, creating more manageable intermediate values and flexible pathways to 24. Early consolidation reduces complexity and helps explore multiplicative routes.\n\n2. **Leveraging 8 and 3 for Direct Multiplication:**  \n   Once the 4s are combined into 8, consider multiplying 8 by 3 directly:  \n   \\[\n   8 \\times 3 = 24\n   \\]  \n   This is the most straightforward solution if the current set permits. To achieve this, you need to isolate 8 and 3 together, which often involves removing or manipulating 13.\n\n3. **Using 13 to Generate Useful Intermediates:**  \n   Since 13 is close to 12, operations that bring it nearer to a multiple of 12, such as subtracting 1, can be effective. For example:  \n   \\[\n   13 - 4 = 9\n   \\]  \n   This step is valid and produces 9, but subsequent steps must be carefully chosen because combining 9 with remaining numbers to reach 24 is not straightforward. The key is recognizing that after this step, the",

Building on previous insights, the key steps are:\n\n1. **Combine the Two 4s Early:**  \n   Start by adding the two 4s:  \n   \\[\n   4 + 4 = 8\n   \\]  \n   This reduces the four-number set to 3, 8, and 13, simplifying the problem and creating a flexible intermediate. Combining the 4s into 8 is optimal because it creates a manageable number that can be easily multiplied with 3 to approach 24.\n\n2. **Manipulate 13 to Generate Near-Multiples of 12 or 24:**  \n   Since directly multiplying 8 by 3 yields 24, aim to position 3 and 8 together. To do this, consider modifying 13 to produce a multiple of 12 or 24. For example, subtract 1 from 13:  \n   \\[\n   13 - 1 = 12\n   \\]  \n   To generate 1, subtract 12 from 13, but since 12 isn't directly available, look for other ways. Alternatively, subtract 4 from 13:  \n   \\[\n   13 - 4 = 9\n   \\]  \n   While 9 alone doesn't help reach 24 directly, combining it with other operations could. The key is to find operations that bring 13 closer to a multiple of 12 or 24, enabling straightforward multiplication with 8 or 3.\n\n3. **Prioritize",

                    "summary": "To effectively solve the set of numbers 3, 4, 4, 13 in the Game of 24, the key is recognizing straightforward summation options and avoiding invalid operations. The previous attempt suggested manipulating the numbers with operations like \"13 - 9,\" which is invalid because 9 does not exist in the initial set. This highlights the importance of ensuring all intermediate values are derived strictly from the original numbers through permissible operations.\n\n**Core Strategy for 3, 4, 4, 13:**\n\n1. **Identify Immediate Summation Opportunities:**  \n   The simplest and most direct solution involves summing all four numbers:\n   \\[\n   13 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 24\n   \\]\n   This approach is valid, uses all four numbers exactly once, and requires no complex intermediate steps. Recognizing such straightforward solutions is often the most efficient pathway.\n\n2. **Avoid Invalid Operations and Reuse of Nonexistent Values:**  \n   The previous attempt's error stemmed from attempting to subtract 9 from 13 to get 4, which is invalid because 9 isn't part of the initial set, nor was it created in prior steps. In the Game of 24, only numbers present initially or derived through legitimate operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are permissible at each step.\n\n3. **Leverage Addition for Simplicity:**  \n   Since addition is associative and commutative, combining the numbers directly is often the easiest route:\n   \\[\n   13 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 24\n   \\]\n   This eliminates unnecessary complexity and reduces the risk of invalid steps.\n\n4. **Consider Alternative Approaches Only If Necessary:**  \n   While the direct summation works perfectly here, if one seeks other solutions, focus on pairing numbers to reach intermediate targets close to 24\u2014for example, multiplying two numbers to get 24 directly or creating intermediate steps like 12 or 8 that can be combined with remaining numbers. However, in this specific case, such efforts are unnecessary because the simplest sum is already 24.\n\n5. **Check for Single-Step Solutions First:**  \n   Always scan the initial set for any immediate combinations that produce 24. For example, since ",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves for the numbers 3, 4, 4, 13 within the Game of 24, the key principles are: prioritize intermediate values that are manageable (roughly 8\u201312) to maintain flexibility, and avoid steps that produce impossible or divergent results. Moves that combine numbers to yield intermediate totals within this range facilitate efficient progression toward 24. Conversely, steps that generate results outside this manageable window\u2014especially those involving invalid operations or impossible values\u2014should be avoided, as they hinder solution pathways. It's crucial to ensure each operation uses only the current set of numbers without reusing or introducing external values. For example, subtracting a number not present in the current set, or creating negative or fractional results that complicate reaching 24, indicates an unpromising move. Valid steps often involve simple addition, subtraction"

The clear, straightforward approach is to sum all four numbers:\n\n\\[ 13 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 24 \\]\n\nThis total uses each number exactly once and requires no complex intermediate steps, making it the most efficient solution and reducing the risk of errors.\n\nKey insights derived from previous attempts and new learnings emphasize the importance of adhering strictly to permissible operations and initial values. For example, attempting to create intermediate values like 17 by adding 13 and 4 is valid mathematically but invalid within the game's rules if 17 was not an existing number or derived from previous steps. Operations must be performed only on numbers available from the initial set or those generated through valid calculations at each step.\n\nGiven these constraints, avoid steps like \"13 + 4 = 17\" unless 17 is explicitly derived from previous operations, which it isn't in this context. Such steps are labeled \"impossible\" because they introduce a new value not present in the preceding set. This highlights that only combining original numbers directly or through valid intermediate calculations is permissible.\n\nWhile multiple solutions can exist, this particular set benefits from immediate summation since the total reaches 24 directly. If exploring alternative methods, consider pairing numbers to reach intermediate targets close to 24\u2014like multiplying 4 and 6 if possible\u2014but in this case, the simplest sum is optimal.\n\nIn summary, focus on identifying quick, valid combinations that reach 24 immediately. Always verify that each step",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves for the numbers 3, 4, 4, 13 in the Game of 24, the core principles emphasize creating manageable intermediate values to maintain flexibility toward reaching 24. Effective moves tend to produce results within a moderate range, approximately 8 to 12, which serve as stepping stones rather than dead ends. For example, combining 13 and 4 to get 17 is legal and keeps the puzzle progressing, as 17 is close to the target and allows subsequent operations to adjust toward 24. Conversely, steps that generate values outside this manageable window\u2014such as resulting in 17 when combined with other large numbers\u2014can complicate solution pathways or result in dead ends.\n\nA key criterion is operation validity: moves must strictly use the current set of available numbers, without reusing or introducing external values. Illegal moves\u2014such as attempting to combine a number not in the current set, producing negative results, or creating fractional or impossible totals\u2014should be avoided. For example, adding 13 and 4"

                    "summary": "To effectively solve the 24 game with the numbers 2, 5, 8, and 11, focus on the following refined strategies based on recent insights:\n\n1. **Avoid Invalid Operations and Respect the Rules**  \nRecent attempts highlight that operations must strictly involve only the given numbers at each step, without reusing or dropping numbers improperly. For example, using 8 - 5 = 3 is valid in isolation, but if the subsequent operations rely on intermediate steps that violate turn-by-turn legality, the entire approach fails. Always ensure each operation uses current remaining numbers exactly once and that no number is introduced from outside the initial set.\n\n2. **Prioritize Direct Combinations of Larger Numbers**  \nGiven the initial set, look for ways to combine larger numbers to reach intermediate targets close to 24. For instance, combining 8 and 11 directly:  \n- 8 + 11 = 19  \n- 8 * 11 = 88 (too large)  \n- 11 - 8 = 3\n\nFocusing on these can simplify the path. For example, 8 + 11 = 19 leaves 2 and 5, which can then be combined to reach 5 (already present) or 10 (by 2 * 5).  \n\n3. **Leverage Multiplication and Division for Larger or Smaller Results**  \nMultiplication tends to produce larger numbers that can be adjusted downward via subtraction or division. For example, 5 * 2 = 10, which is close to 12, and then combined with 8 or 11. Conversely, division can help reduce large intermediate results:  \n- 8 / 2 = 4  \n- 11 / 5 \u2248 2.2 (not an integer, so less useful)  \n\nIdentify scenarios where division yields whole numbers, enabling easier combination toward 24.\n\n4. **Use Strategic Pairings",

Prioritize pairing larger numbers first to reach intermediate targets near 24. For example, combine 8 and 11 directly:  \n- 8 + 11 = 19  \n- 8 * 11 = 88 (too large, less promising)  \n- 11 - 8 = 3 (useful for further steps if combined with remaining numbers)\n\nNext, consider using 5 and 2 to reach 10 via multiplication (5 * 2 = 10), which can help bridge toward 24. For instance, after obtaining 19 from 8 + 11, adding 5 and 2 strategically can approach 24:  \n- 19 + 5 = 24 (if 5 is still available and operationally valid)  \n- Or, combine 10 (from 5 * 2) with other partial results to reach 24.\n\nLeverage",

Avoid combining 8 and 11 directly, as their sum (19) leads to dead ends, evidenced by previous attempts. Instead, prioritize operations that produce intermediate results closer to 24, such as multiplying smaller pairs or adding combinations that approach the target.\n\nKey refined strategies:\n\n1. **Use multiplication of smaller numbers to approach 24:**  \n   - For example, multiply 5 and 2 to get 10 (5 * 2 = 10).  \n   - Combining 10 with other results is often more promising than working with large sums that overshoot or lead nowhere.\n\n2. **Avoid combining 8 and 11 directly:**  \n   - The sum 19 (8 + 11) has been proven unproductive in leading to 24, confirmed by the recent analysis.  \n   - Refrain from using 8 + 11 as a starting point.\n\n3. **Explore multiplication involving 8 or 11 to reach 24:**  \n   - For instance, 8 * 3 = 24 is ideal, but since 3 isn't directly available, consider creating 3 from remaining numbers (e.g., 5 - 2 = 3).  \n   - Combining 11 and 2: 11",

Avoid combining 8 and 11 directly, as their sum (19) historically leads to no solution. Instead, leverage multiplication of smaller pairs to generate key intermediate results\u2014multiplying 5 and 2 to get 10 is promising, as it simplifies subsequent steps toward 24. For instance, multiplying 5 by 2 yields 10; then, multiplying 8 by a factor or adding/subtracting from 10 can inch closer to 24. Creating 3 from remaining numbers (e.g., 5 - 2) is valid, but recent attempts confirm that such subtractions often don\u2019t lead to 24 when combined with 8 and 11. Specifically, after obtaining 3 from 5 - 2, the remaining numbers 8 and 11 don\u2019t combine effectively to reach 24, as previous analysis indicates. To maximize success, focus on operations involving small numbers\u2014such as multiplying 5 and 2,",

Prioritize operations involving small numbers, especially multiplication of 2 and 5 to generate 10, a key stepping stone. For example, multiplying 5 by 2 yields 10, which can then be combined with other numbers to reach 24 more straightforwardly (e.g., 10 \u00d7 2.4, if fractional operations are allowed, or combining with 8 and 11 in ways that approach 24). \n\nAvoid directly adding 8 and 11 to get 19 because this creates an intermediate sum that doesn't naturally lead to 24 and, as previous attempts suggest, combining 19 with remaining numbers often fails to reach the target. Instead, consider subtracting smaller numbers to generate useful multiples or factors; for example, 11 - 2 = 9, which can be combined with 8 to reach 24 via multiplication or addition. \n\nGiven the constraints, a promising approach is to create 10 from 2 and 5, then multiply that by 2 (which can be obtained from 8 - 6, if intermediate steps are permissible) or combine 8 and 11 differently. The critical insight is to avoid using 8 + 11 directly in a way that leaves no viable subsequent steps, as previous failed attempts confirm. Instead, look for ways to generate",

Avoid reusing or dropping numbers improperly, as the rules prohibit reusing numbers or combining them in ways that violate the initial set. Every step must directly operate on the remaining numbers without introducing new or duplicate elements.\n\n2. **Focus on Constructing Key Intermediate Values:**  \n   Prioritize creating intermediate numbers that simplify reaching 24. From the previous attempts, generating 10 is promising\u2014multiply 2 and 5 to get 10. This step is legal, straightforward, and leads to manageable subsequent calculations.\n\n3. **Avoid Unproductive Sums or Subtractions that Lead to Dead-Ends:**  \n   Adding 8 and 11 to get 19, as attempted earlier, does not naturally lead to 24 and often complicates the path. Similarly, subtracting small numbers to generate useful factors (e.g., 11 - 2 = 9) can be beneficial, but be cautious about the legality of each operation\u2014ensure that the numbers used are present and not previously discarded improperly.\n\n4. **Leverage Multiplication of Small Numbers:**  \n   Multiplying 2 and 5 to get 10 is often a useful step. From there, consider multiplying 10 by 2 (which can be obtained from 8 - 6 if intermediate steps are permissible; otherwise, look for direct combinations) or combining it with",

Instead, consider subtracting small, strategic differences\u2014such as 11 - 8 = 3\u2014since 3 can factor into 24 via multiplication (3\u00d78=24). For example, after obtaining 3, multiply it by 8 to reach 24 directly. Also, explore subtracting 2 from 5 to get 3, then multiply by 8 (3\u00d78=24).

A key insight is to target the creation of the number 3, since 3\u00d78=24, or to produce 12 via multiplication or addition, then multiply accordingly.\n\nFrom the previous learnings, avoid reusing numbers once they've been used in a step. For example, dividing 8 by 2 to get 4 is valid, but subsequent operations must only involve remaining unused numbers. The previous attempt's mistake was reusing '2' after it was already used in 8/2, which is invalid, so only use each number once per entire solution.\n\nAnother strategy is to manipulate 5 and 11 to create useful intermediate values. For instance, subtracting 11 - 8 = 3 is promising because 3 can be multiplied by 8 to reach 24. Alternatively, subtracting 2 from 5 yields 3, which can then be multiplied by 8 to make 24.

This refined approach prioritizes creating manageable intermediate results and exploiting key operations that bridge the gap to 24.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Focus on Creating 3 or 12 as Intermediate Values:**  \n   Since 24 factors into 3 and 8 (i.e., 3\u00d78=24), generating 3 or 12 early on simplifies reaching 24. For instance, subtracting 8 from 11 yields 3 (11 - 8 = 3), which is a promising step because multiplying 3 by 8 results directly in 24. Similarly, creating 12 via addition or multiplication of remaining numbers can serve as a stepping stone.\n\n2. **Targeted Operations to Generate 3:**  \n   From the current numbers, subtracting 8 from 11 yields 3, a key intermediate. Alternatively, subtracting 2 from 5 gives 3 (5 - 2 = 3). Once 3 is established, multiplying it by 8 or 4 can reach 24. Prioritize operations that produce this 3, as it unlocks direct paths to 24.\n\n3. **Avoid Reusing Numbers and Respecting Usage Constraints:**  \n   Each number can only be used once in the entire chain of operations. For example, after using 11 and 8 to produce 3, neither 11 nor 8 can be reused. This restricts the options and guides the sequence\u2014once a number is consumed, it cannot reappear.\n\n4. **Manipulate Remaining Numbers Strategically:**  \n   After generating 3, examine how to incorporate remaining numbers (2 and 5). Multiplying 5 by 3 gives 15; adding 2 to 15 yields 17, which is not helpful. Alternatively, multiplying 2 and 5 yields 10; multiplying by 3 does not directly reach 24, but these can be combined differently.\n\n5. **Use Addition or Subtraction to Adjust Values:**  \n   When direct multiplication isn't straightforward, consider addition or subtraction to reach a useful intermediate. For example, 5 - 2 = 3, which can",

The previous attempts highlight that simple addition or subtraction alone often lead to dead ends, so focusing on operations that create these intermediates efficiently is crucial.\n\n**Core Strategy Refinement:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Creating 3 or 12 as Intermediate Values:**  \n   These numbers are pivotal because they have straightforward multiplicative paths to 24. For example, multiplying 3 by 8 yields 24, so generating 3 early on can streamline the solution. Similarly, creating 12 can be helpful since 12\u00d72=24 or 12\u00d72=24, but in this specific set, 12 is less directly accessible, so generating 3 is often more practical.\n\n2. **Leverage Subtraction to Generate 3:**  \n   From the current set, subtracting 8 from 11 produces 3 (11 - 8 = 3), which is a promising step because multiplying this 3 by 8 yields 24. Alternatively, subtracting 2 from 5 yields 3 (5 - 2 = 3). These operations are efficient because they directly generate the key intermediate with minimal steps, respecting the rule of using each number once.\n\n3. **Sequence of Operations for the Current Numbers:**  \n   Starting with 2, 5, 8, and 11, a promising sequence is:  \n   - Use 11 and 8: 11 - 8 = 3  \n   - Now, with 3, and remaining numbers 2 and 5, look for ways to combine these to reach 24.  \n   - Multiplying 3 by 8 (which we already used) is not possible anymore, so focus on utilizing the leftover 2 and 5.  \n   \n   Since 8 is used to generate 3, we cannot reuse 8, so we need to find a different path. Alternatively, explore different initial operations:\n   \n4. **Alternative Approaches:**  \n   - Use 5 and 2: 5 - 2 = 3  \n   - With 3, remaining 8 and 11, check if any operations lead to 24:  \n     - 8 + 11 = 19 (no)  \n     - 8 \u00d7 11 = 88 (no)  \n     - (",

Past attempts highlight that direct addition or subtraction often leads to dead ends, so prioritize operations that produce these key intermediates efficiently, while respecting the rule of using each number only once.\n\n**Refined Strategy for 2, 5, 8, and 11:**\n\n1. **Target Key Intermediate Values (3 and 12):**  \n   Generating 3 or 12 early on provides multiple routes to 24. For example, multiplying 3 by 8 yields 24, so creating 3 with minimal steps is advantageous. While 12 can be multiplied by 2 or 2.5 to reach 24, in this specific set, producing 3 is often more direct.\n\n2. **Utilize Subtraction to Generate 3:**  \n   - From 11 and 8: `11 - 8 = 3`  \n   - From 5 and 2: `5 - 2 = 3`  \n   \n   These operations quickly produce the desired 3, which can then be multiplied by 8 or 3 to reach 24. Prioritizing these subtractions is efficient because they use only two numbers and produce a useful intermediate with minimal steps.\n\n3. **Sequence of Operations to Reach 24:**\n   - **Option A:**  \n     - Step 1: `11 - 8 = 3` (left: 2, 5, 3)  \n     - Step 2: `3 \u00d7 8` \u2014 but 8 is already used, so this path is invalid unless we generate a new 8. Instead, use the remaining numbers:  \n     - From 5 and 2: `5 - 2 = 3` (left: 8, 3, 11)  \n     - Now, with 3, multiply by 8: `3 \u00d7 8 = 24`  \n     - Remaining number: 11; since we've achieved 24, the process is complete.  \n\n   - **Option B:**  \n     - Use `5 - 2 = 3`  \n     - Then, combine 3 with 8: `3 \u00d7",

Effective operations involve combining numbers with legal arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) without reusing or misusing individual numbers\u2014each number must be used exactly once per step. Moves that produce results outside the feasible target range or eliminate crucial numbers prematurely tend to hinder solving. Illegal moves\u2014such as using the same number twice without replacement\u2014are invalid and should be avoided. Successful"

Producing 3 is often more straightforward with these numbers, especially via subtraction, which is a minimal and reliable operation.\n\n2. **Use Subtraction to Quickly Generate 3:**  \n   The most direct method observed is subtracting smaller numbers from larger ones\u2014specifically:  \n   - `11 - 8 = 3`  \n   - `5 - 2 = 3`  \n   \n   Both operations use only two numbers, are straightforward, and produce a useful intermediate with minimal steps. This aligns with the previous summary's emphasis on quick generation of key intermediates.\n\n3. **Avoid Overcomplicating or Using Invalid Number Sets:**  \n   Recent feedback indicates that any subsequent operation must strictly involve the original numbers or their immediate results without reusing or misusing numbers outside the current set. For example, after generating 3 via `11 - 8`, subsequent steps must use only the remaining numbers (2 and 5) or previously obtained results. Any attempt to reuse numbers improperly, or to operate on numbers not present in the current set, leads to invalid solutions.\n\n4. **Focus on Valid, Single-Step Subtractions First:**  \n   To streamline the process, prioritize subtracting larger from smaller numbers where possible to produce 3, as this provides a foundation for multiplying to reach 24.\n\n**Concrete Strategy for 2, 5, 8, 11:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Generate the key intermediate 3 using subtraction:  \n  `11 - 8 = 3`  \n  Remaining numbers: 2, 5, and the result 3 (from previous step).\n\n- **Step 2:** Use the remaining numbers to reach 24.  \n  Now, with 3, 2, and 5, consider the following options:\n\n  - Multiply 3 by 8: Not possible here because 8 has been used.  \n  - Multiply 3 by 8:",

The critical insights from previous analyses and recent feedback guide us toward an optimized, step-by-step strategy tailored specifically for this set.\n\n---\n\n### Core Principles\n\n1. **Prioritize Generating 3 via Subtraction:**  \n   The simplest and most reliable method to produce 3 from these numbers is through subtraction, specifically:\n   - `11 - 8 = 3`  \n   - or `5 - 2 = 3`  \n\n   Both are straightforward, involve only two numbers, and produce a useful intermediate with minimal steps. Generating 3 early provides a flexible building block for reaching 24 because of the simple multiplication: `3 * 8 = 24`.\n\n2. **Use Valid, Non-Repetitive Operations:**  \n   According to recent feedback, once a number is used in an operation, it cannot be reused or dropped arbitrarily in subsequent steps. Each move must involve only the current set of numbers or their immediate results, maintaining the integrity of the game rules.\n\n3. **Avoid Complex or Unnecessary Operations:**  \n   Instead of convoluted combinations, focus on direct operations that produce meaningful intermediates. For example, multiplying an already obtained 3 by 8 directly yields 24, which is the target, without unnecessary intermediate steps.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Strategy for 2, 5, 8, and 11\n\n**Step 1:** Generate the key intermediate 3  \n- Use the subtraction `11 - 8 = 3`  \n- **Remaining numbers:** 2, 5, and the result 3\n\n*Note:* This step is **sure** and uses only original numbers, aligning with the rules and previous confirmation.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2:** Use the remaining numbers to reach 24  \n- Since the goal is to get 24, and we have 3, the most straightforward approach is to multiply 3 by 8, but 8 has been used in Step 1, so it\u2019s no longer available. Alternatively, explore options with remaining numbers:\n\n  - Multiply 3 by 8 is invalid now, as 8 was used; so consider other combinations.\n\n**Key realization:**  \n-",

Moves resulting in outcomes outside a manageable range or prematurely removing key numbers impede solution pathways. Illegal moves\u2014such as reusing numbers or operating on numbers not in the current set\u2014are invalid and should be disregarded. When evaluating moves, prioritize those that produce intermediate results close to 2 or 4, as these are more conducive to combining into 24. After each move, verify the remaining numbers are derived correctly from the previous set, ensuring no invalid operations occurred.

For example, creating 3 out of thin air or combining previously obtained numbers without proper derivation is invalid.\n\n2. **Use of Valid, Non-Repetitive Operations:**  \n   - Each step must involve only the current set of numbers or their immediate results, respecting the \"once used\" rule.  \n   - No operation can reuse a number already consumed unless it is explicitly carried over as part of the current set of available numbers.\n\n3. **Avoid Overcomplicating with Unnecessary Operations:**  \n   - Focus on direct, simple calculations to produce intermediates rather than convoluted combinations.  \n   - For example, multiplying 3 by 8 directly yields 24, but only if 3 is legitimately derived from the initial set.\n\n---\n\n**Applying These Principles to the Current Set (2, 5, 8, 11):**\n\n**Step 1: Generate the intermediate 3 reliably**  \n- Use `11 - 8 = 3`.  \n",

Valid operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\u2014must combine the current numbers exactly once per move, preserving legality and logical progression. Moves that produce outcomes outside manageable ranges or prematurely eliminate key numbers hinder solution pathways. Crucially, each step must operate solely on the current set of numbers, with no reuse or creation of new numbers unless explicitly derived from previous operations. Creating intermediate values not present in the original set, such as 3, without performing a valid operation on existing numbers, constitutes an illegal move. After each move, verify that the remaining numbers are correctly derived and that no invalid steps\u2014like reusing numbers or operating on nonexistent values\u2014occurred. Effective moves tend to reduce the problem to smaller, manageable intermediate targets (like 2 or 4) that can be combined into 24. Conversely, moves that generate inaccessible or invalid intermediate results, or that drop crucial numbers prematurely, make the puzzle more difficult or impossible.

Here\u2019s a focused, concise approach tailored explicitly to the set 2, 5, 8, and 11:\n\n**1. Prioritize Generating the Number 3 via Valid Operations**  \nThe most direct way to produce 3 is through subtraction using the original numbers:  \n- `11 - 8 = 3` (valid, uses available numbers, leaves 2, 5, and 3)  \n- Alternatively, `5 - 2 = 3` (also valid, leaves 8, 11, and 3)  \n\nGenerating 3 early is crucial because once obtained, you can multiply it by 8 or 5 to approach 24 efficiently. For instance:  \n- `3 * 8 = 24` (if 3 and 8 are both available and derived legitimately)  \n- Or `3 * 5 = 15`, then adding or multiplying further to reach 24.\n\n**2. Use Only Valid, One-Time Operations on the Remaining Numbers**  \nEvery operation must involve only the current set of available numbers, each used exactly once per step. No reusing numbers or combining previously used intermediates without re-derivation. For example:  \n- After `11 - 8 = 3`, the remaining numbers are 2, 5, and 3.  \n- You cannot reintroduce 8 or 11 without re-deriving them.  \n- If you generate 3 from `11 - 8`, then multiply `3 * 8` is invalid unless you explicitly have 8 available again; in this scenario, you do not, because 8 was used in the subtraction.\n\n**3. Simplify Step Sequences to Minimize Invalid Moves**  \nAvoid complex, multi-step combinations that re-use or drop numbers improperly. Instead, focus on straightforward calculations:  \n- Derive 3 from the initial",
                    "value_summary": "**Updated Evaluation Model for the 2, 5, 8, 11 Puzzle**\n\nWhen approaching the 2, 5, 8, 11 puzzle, effective moves are characterized by their strategic guidance toward intermediate targets that facilitate reaching 24\u2014primarily focusing on the numbers 2 and 4. Valid operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) must be performed exactly once per move on the current set of numbers, with no reuse or creation of new numbers outside the original set unless explicitly derived from previous valid operations. Moves that generate intermediate values outside manageable ranges or that eliminate crucial numbers prematurely hinder progress. \n\nKey principles include:\n\n1. **Legality and Validity:** Each move must operate solely on the current set of remaining numbers, respecting the rule of using each number once per move. No illegal reuse or creation of new numbers without proper operations is allowed. For example, deriving a number like 3 without a valid operation on existing numbers is invalid.\n\n2. **Progression Toward Intermediate Targets:** Moves should aim to reduce the problem to smaller, manageable intermediates like 2 or 4, which are easier to combine into 24. For instance, combining 8 and 3 via multiplication (8 * 3 = 24) directly solves the puzzle if both are available and no rules are violated.\n\n3. **Avoid Premature Elimination:** Do not eliminate key numbers prematurely or produce outcomes that leave no feasible path to 24. For example, creating large or inaccessible intermediate values or dropping crucial numbers before their utility is exhausted makes the puzzle more difficult"

Alternatively, consider:\n\n- **Step 2 (alternative):** Use 3 and 5:  \n  `3 * 5 = 15`  \n  Then, add or multiply further with remaining numbers to reach 24, such as adding 8:\n\n- **Step 3:** Add 8 to 15:  \n  `15 + 8 = 23` \u2014 close but not 24, so this path is less direct.\n\nTo optimize, generate 3 early via subtraction, then multiply it immediately by 8 or 5:\n\n- **Method to reach 24 efficiently:**  \n  1. `11 - 8 = 3` (left: 3, 2, 5)  \n ",

The core principles are:\n\n1. **Legality and Validity of Moves:** Each step must operate solely on the current set of remaining numbers, using each number exactly once per move. Moves that reuse numbers improperly or create new numbers without valid operations violate rules and are invalid. For example, deriving a number like 3 without a proper operation on existing numbers is invalid.\n\n2. **Progression Toward Manageable Intermediates:** Moves should aim to produce or preserve intermediate values that facilitate reaching 24 efficiently\u2014especially 2 and 4. Combining small numbers (e.g., 2 and 2 to make 4) or producing these intermediates early on helps streamline the solution.\n\n3. **Avoid Premature Elimination of Key Numbers:** Do not eliminate or use up crucial numbers prematurely, especially those that can be combined later into 24. Creating large, inaccessible intermediate values or removing key numbers before their utility is exhausted hampers progress.\n\n4. **Monitoring the State of Remaining Numbers:** After each move, verify that the remaining numbers are consistent with valid operations and that no illegal reuse has occurred.

Past attempts have highlighted the importance of choosing operations that adhere strictly to the rules: each number can only be used once per calculation, and operations must involve only the current set of remaining numbers.\n\n**Critical Insight:**\n- Generating a 3 early is highly advantageous because `3 * 8 = 24` and `3 * 8` is straightforward if 3 is available.\n- The most direct way to produce 3 is via subtraction involving 11 and 8:  \n  `11 - 8 = 3`  \n  This uses two of the original numbers and leaves 2 and 5 unused, making subsequent multiplication simple.\n\n**Applying this:**\n- **Step 1:** `11 - 8 = 3`  \n  Remaining numbers: 2, 5, and the new 3.\n\n- **Step 2:** Multiply 3 by 8 or 5 to reach 24. Since 8 has been used in the first step, it is no longer available unless re-derived. Therefore, multiplying 3 by 8 is invalid here unless 8 is reintroduceable, which it isn't. Instead, using 3 and 5:  \n  `3 * 5 = 15`  \n  Remaining numbers: 2, and the result 15.\n\n- **Step 3:** Add or multiply remaining numbers to reach 24.  \n  `15 + 2 + 7` or other combinations don't directly lead to 24, so this path becomes less efficient.\n\n**Alternative Approach:**\n\n- Generate 3 early as above, then use",

This intermediate value of 3 is particularly useful because multiplying it by 8 or 5 can directly yield 24 (e.g., `3 \u00d7 8 = 24`), but only if the numbers involved are still available. \n\nKey insights:\n\n- Use `11 - 8 = 3` early to generate a manageable intermediate.\n- After creating 3, explore multiplying it by 8 or 5 to reach 24:\n  - `3 \u00d7 8 = 24` (if 8 is available, but it has been used in the subtraction, so it's no longer available)\n  - `3 \u00d7 5 = 15`, which requires additional operations to reach 24.\n- Since 8 is used in the subtraction, focus on other combinations:\n  - Combine remaining numbers to reach 24, such as `2 + 5 + 17` (not possible directly), or manipulate pairs to get 12 and then double.\n",

Generating a manageable intermediate like 3 early on is crucial, as it opens pathways to reach 24 through multiplication.\n\n2. **Recognize the Limitations After the First Step**\n\nPost this move, the remaining numbers are **2, 5, 3**. Any subsequent attempts must only use these numbers without reusing or dropping others. The previous attempt confirms that:\n\n- Combining these to reach exactly 24 is **not straightforward**.\n- Common operations on 2, 5, and 3 (such as `2 * 5 * 3 = 30`, or `(5 - 3) * 2 = 4`) do not yield 24.\n- Formulas like `(2 + 3) * 5 = 25` are close but insufficient.\n\n3. **Disallow Reuse of Used Numbers**\n\nThe feedback emphasizes that further steps must only involve the remaining numbers, and each operation must be legal\u2014i.e., no reusing or dropping numbers mid-calculation.\n\n- Since 8 and 11 are used in the initial subtraction, they cannot be used again.\n- Any attempt to involve 8 or 11 after their subtraction is invalid.\n\n4. **Attempting to Reach 24 with Remaining Numbers is Not Feasible**\n\n- The options with 2, 5, 3 do not produce 24:\n  - `2 * 5 * 3 = 30` (close but overshoot)\n  - `(2 + 3) * 5 = 25` (just over 24)\n  - `(5 - 3) * 2 = 4` (too small)\n  - `2 * (5 + 3) = 16` (too small)\n- No combination directly yields 24.\n\n5. **Implication",

Combine remaining small numbers effectively: adding 11 + 1 yields 12, which is valid if both numbers are available and unused. This sequence\u2014(4 + 7) = 11, then (11 + 1) = 12\u2014is promising, as it maintains the integrity of the numbers and is based on valid operations.\n\n3. Avoid operations involving numbers not present in the current set of unused numbers. For example, dividing by 3 is invalid if 3 is not generated earlier, as seen in the previous attempt.\n\n4. From 12, aim to reach 24 by multiplying or adding suitable combinations. Since 12 x 2 = 24, seek to produce 2 from the remaining numbers",

For example, adding 4 and 7 to get 11, then combining 11 with 1 to reach 12, are promising steps.

Focus on generating intermediate results that facilitate reaching 24 through straightforward operations, avoiding convoluted or invalid steps.\n\nKey insights:\n\n1. **Prioritize combining larger numbers early:** Use 4 and 7 to produce manageable intermediates. For example, 4 + 7 = 11 is promising, as it simplifies the remaining numbers to 1 and 2. This sets a foundation for building toward 24.\n\n2. **Utilize simple arithmetic with small numbers:** After forming 11, adding 1 yields 12, a critical intermediate since 12 is a multiple of 24. For instance, (4 + 7) = 11, then (11 + 1) = 12. This approach maintains the integrity of remaining numbers and keeps options open.\n\n3. **Avoid invalid operations or assumptions about combining numbers arbitrarily:** Combining 1 and 2 directly into 12 is only valid if the game rules permit combining numbers before applying operations. If not, such steps are invalid. Always ensure each move involves only the original numbers or valid intermediate results.\n\n4. **Focus on reaching 24 directly from intermediate results:** Since 12 \u00d7 2 = 24, aim to produce a 2 from the remaining numbers. After forming 12, the remaining numbers are 1, 2, 4, and 7. The challenge is to generate 2 from these, possibly through division or subtraction, or to find an alternative route.\n\nApplying these refined",

Past attempts reveal that the core challenge lies not just in arithmetic prowess but in adherence to legitimate operations that respect the initial set of numbers at every step. Drawing from previous learnings and recent analyses, the following refined strategy emphasizes legal intermediate steps, strategic combination priorities, and targeted intermediate goals to efficiently reach the target of 24.\n\n1. **Prioritize Valid Intermediate Steps and Operations**\n\nAny intermediate calculation must be derived from the original numbers or previously obtained valid results. Operations that produce intermediate numbers outside the realm of these numbers\u2014such as sums like 11 (from 4 + 7)\u2014are valid as long as they directly result from combining available numbers, but the key is to avoid overly complicated or unnecessary intermediate results that do not facilitate reaching 24 efficiently.\n\n2. **Focus on Combining Larger Numbers First**\n\nCombining larger numbers early reduces the complexity of subsequent steps. For example, combining 7 and 4 yields 11, which is a manageable intermediate. This is strategic because 11 can be combined with the remaining numbers to approach 24 more directly than less strategic pairings.\n\n3. **Leverage Multiplication and Recognize Key Multiples**\n\nRecognize that reaching a multiple of 12 is instrumental, since 24 is double 12. Once you can produce 12, multiplying by 2 yields 24 efficiently. Hence, the goal should be to generate 12 from the available numbers via addition or other operations.\n\n4. **Create Intermediate Numbers Like 8 or 12 from the Given Set**\n\nCreating 8 or 12 is crucial because they serve as stepping stones toward 24. For instance:\n- To produce 8, combine 4 and 2 (4 + 4) is invalid since only one 4 exists, but 4 + 2 = 6, no; or 2 * 4 = 8, which is valid.\n- To produce 12, combine 4 and 8, but since 8 isn't directly available, consider alternative combinations:\n  - 7 + 1 = 8, then 8 + 4 = 12 (if the previous steps allow this).\n  - Or, combine 4 + 4 + 4 is invalid (only one 4), so focus on the direct operations.\n\n5. **Use Subtractions and Divisions Strategically**\n\nSubtraction can help reduce larger numbers to manageable sizes, while division can help generate smaller numbers or fractions if needed, provided they lead toward 24.\n\n6. **Example Valid Strategy Workflow**\n\n- Step 1: Combine 7 and 1 to get 6 (7 - 1 = 6).  \n  Leftover numbers: 2, 4, 6\n\n- Step 2: Combine 4 and 2 to get 8 (4 * 2 = 8).  \n  Leftover numbers: 6, ",

Past attempts highlight that success depends not just on arithmetical ingenuity but on strict adherence to valid, stepwise transformations derived solely from the original numbers and previously obtained valid results.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Legitimate Intermediate Results:**  \nEach operation must combine available numbers, whether initial or intermediate, without introducing extraneous values or reusing numbers improperly. For example, after subtracting 1 from 7 to get 6, subsequent steps must involve the remaining numbers 2, 4, and the new 6\u2014never reusing or inventing numbers outside these.\n\n2. **Prioritize Combining Larger Numbers First:**  \nStarting with larger number pairings often simplifies the path forward. For instance, combining 7 and 1 early yields 6, a manageable intermediate. Similarly, pairing 4 and 2 to produce 8 is a productive step, as 8 is a useful target for reaching 24.\n\n3. **Create and Use Key Intermediate Numbers (8, 12):**  \nGenerating intermediate milestones like 8 or 12 is crucial because these facilitate multiplication to reach 24 or other intermediates. For example:\n- To produce 8, multiply 4 and 2: (4 * 2 = 8).  \n- To generate 12, combining 4 and 8 is effective, but since 8 needs to be produced first, focus on creating 8 from the initial numbers.\n\n4. **Leverage Multiplication for Efficiency:**  \nMultiplication is the most direct route to reach 24 once the right intermediate is available. For example, if you can generate 12, then multiplying by 2 yields 24. Alternatively, doubling 12 (from 4 and 8) is straightforward if those intermediates are established.\n\n5. **Use Subtraction and Division to Adjust Magnitudes:**  \nSubtraction can reduce larger numbers or create needed differences, while division can generate smaller fractions if they lead closer to 24.

Effective moves produce intermediate values that are either directly useful or serve as stepping stones toward 24. Producing numbers outside the scope of the current set or that cannot be combined meaningfully indicates dead ends. For example, creating intermediate values like 6 (from 7 - 1) is promising because it remains compatible with remaining numbers and can be integrated into subsequent operations. Conversely, intermediate results such as 11 (from 7 + 4) are less useful unless they lead directly or indirectly to 24. Valid steps involve combining two numbers with basic operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014to generate intermediate results that align with remaining numbers or known pathways to 24. Moves that produce invalid or nonsensical intermediates, or that misuse or omit remaining numbers, reduce success likelihood. Tracking remaining numbers after each move is essential to avoid illegal reuse or omission, which indicates an ineffective approach. For the specific set 1, 2, 4, 7, strategic moves often involve creating intermediate values like 6 (from 7 - 1), which can then be combined with other numbers to reach 24 ("

Crucially, operations should be performed carefully to avoid illegal moves like reusing numbers improperly or dropping values without justification.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Create a manageable intermediate \u2014 especially 6 \u2014 via subtraction:**  \n   Starting by subtracting 1 from 7 (`7 - 1 = 6`) is a reliable move. This reduces complexity, produces a useful factor, and preserves the remaining numbers (2 and 4) for subsequent operations. This move is validated as legal and effective.\n\n2. **Generate 8 through multiplication of 2 and 4:**  \n   Using `(4 * 2) = 8` is straightforward and produces a crucial factor that can easily be combined with other intermediates to reach 24.\n\n3. **Combine intermediates through multiplication:**  \n   Once 6 and 8 are available, their multiplication yields 48, which can be halved to reach 24. Alternatively, multiplying 8 by 3 (obtained by dividing 6 by 2) directly reaches 24.\n\n4. **Maintain careful operation sequencing:**  \n   Each step must use only available numbers, and no number should be reused or dropped improperly. When dividing or multiplying, ensure the intermediate results are valid and that all operands are from the current set of remaining numbers.\n\n**Stepwise Strategy:**\n\n- **Step 1:** Subtract 1 from 7:  \n  \\[(7 - 1) = 6\\]  \n  Remaining numbers: 2, 4, and the new 6.  \n  *This step is confirmed as valid and legal.*\n\n- **Step 2:** Generate 8 from 4 and 2:  \n  \\[(4 * 2) = 8\\]  \n  Remaining numbers: 6, 8.  \n  *This step is straightforward and valid.*\n\n- **Step 3:** Use 6 and 2 to create 3, then multiply by 8:  \n  - Divide 6 by 2 to get 3:  \n    \\[(6 / 2) = 3\\]  \n  - Multiply 8 by 3 to get 24:  \n    \\",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 24 game for the initial numbers 1, 2, 4, and 7, effective strategies hinge on generating intermediate results that facilitate reaching 24 without leading to dead ends. The core principle is to produce intermediate values that either directly approach 24 or simplify subsequent calculations. From previous learnings, successful moves often produce intermediate results like 6 (e.g., 7 - 1), because such results remain flexible for further operations\u2014multiplying, adding, or subtracting to approach 24. Conversely, results like 11 (from 7 + 4) tend to be less promising unless they lead directly toward 24, as they can create complex dead ends.\n\nWhen combining two numbers, the goal is to generate a value that can be efficiently used in subsequent steps\u2014either by combining with remaining numbers or by reaching 24 directly. Producing intermediate values that are too large, too small, or not compatible with remaining numbers can hinder progress. For example, creating 6 from 7 - 1 leaves remaining numbers 2, 4, and 6; while 6 is promising, combining it with remaining numbers should be carefully considered to ensure progress toward 24.\n\nTracking remaining numbers after each move is critical. Moves that reuse numbers improperly, drop too many numbers, or produce invalid intermediates are unpromising. For instance, using a sum like 11 or an invalid operation that results in a number not present in the current set indicates a dead end. Valid moves are those that maintain or reduce"

Crucially, each step must strictly adhere to the rules: only using remaining numbers, avoiding reuse or dropping numbers improperly, and ensuring all operations are valid.\n\n**Key Learnings from Past Attempts:**\n\n- Starting with **subtraction to produce 6** remains a reliable move. Specifically, subtracting 1 from 7 (`7 - 1 = 6`) is legal, straightforward, and preserves the remaining numbers (2 and 4) for subsequent operations.\n- Creating **8 via multiplication of 4 and 2** (`4 * 2 = 8`) is direct and effective.\n- To combine these intermediates, multiplying 6 and 4 or 8 and 3 (which can be obtained by dividing 6 by 2) are promising pathways.\n- It\u2019s essential to perform operations sequentially, ensuring no number is reused or discarded without logical justification.\n\n**Updated Approach Based on Recent Feedback:**\n\nThe recent analysis highlights that after performing `7 - 1 = 6`, subsequent attempts to combine remaining numbers must respect the rules. For example, trying to generate 3 by dividing 6 by 2 (`6 / 2 = 3`) is valid, and multiplying this 3 by 8 yields 24 (`8 * 3 = 24`). However, attempts to combine numbers that do not exist or reuse values improperly are invalid.\n\n**Practical, Step-by-Step Strategy:**\n\n1. **Initial Step:**  \n   - Calculate `7 - 1 = 6`  \n   - Remaining numbers: 2, 4, 6  \n   - This step is confirmed valid and legal.\n\n2. **Generate 8:**  \n   - Calculate `4 * 2 = 8`  \n   - Remaining numbers: 6, 8\n\n3. **Create 3 from the remaining numbers:**  \n   - Calculate `6 / 2 = 3`  \n   - Remaining numbers:",

Any move that alters the set of numbers must do so by combining two numbers into a single result, replacing those two with their sum, difference, product, or quotient, and ensuring that the new set reflects these changes accurately. Moves that attempt to use a number more than once or omit numbers are invalid. For example, after the initial step of 7 - 1 = 6, the remaining set is {2, 4, 6}.

The core principles revolve around producing intermediate results that are flexible and conducive to subsequent operations, maintaining strict adherence to proper number usage, and avoiding dead-end calculations.\n\nFirst, successful moves tend to generate intermediate results that open multiple pathways toward 24. For example, producing a value like 6 (via 7 - 1) is promising because 6 can be easily combined with remaining numbers\u2014through addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014to approach 24. Conversely, intermediate results such as 11 (e.g., from 7 + 4) are less advantageous unless they clearly lead toward 24, as they risk creating complex dead ends or invalid states.\n\nSecond, managing the set of remaining numbers after each operation is crucial. Each move must combine exactly two numbers into a new result, replacing those two with a single value that accurately reflects the operation performed. This process reduces the set size by one and maintains the integrity of number usage\u2014no reuse of the same number more than once per move, and no omission of numbers. For example, after performing 7 - 1 = 6, the remaining set becomes {2, 4, 6}. Any subsequent move must involve only these numbers, ensuring the sequence remains valid.\n\nThird, it's vital to avoid illegal steps\u2014those that operate on outdated sets, reuse numbers improperly, or attempt invalid calculations. For instance, attempting to perform an operation on a number that was already used or not present in the current set constitutes an illegal move. Proper tracking of the evolving set of remaining numbers helps prevent such mistakes.\n\nFinally, moves leading toward 24 should"

                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the Game of 24 for the specific set 1, 2, 4, and 7, an effective strategy hinges on understanding how intermediate results influence the pathway toward achieving 24. From prior observations, moves that generate flexible, intermediate values\u2014particularly those that can easily combine with remaining numbers\u2014are more promising. For example, producing a value like 6 through 7 - 1 provides a versatile stepping stone because 6 can be combined with 2 or 4 via addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division to approach 24 efficiently. Conversely, resulting intermediate values that are less directly useful\u2014such as 11 from 7 + 4\u2014are less promising unless they clearly facilitate reaching 24. They tend to create complex dead ends or overly convoluted paths.\n\nEffective move evaluation also emphasizes precise management of the remaining numbers after each operation. Each move must involve exactly two numbers from the current set, with the operation producing a new value that replaces those two, thereby reducing the set size by one. This process ensures no reuse or omission of numbers, maintaining the integrity of the game state. For example, after performing 7 - 1 = 6, the remaining set becomes {2, 4, 6}. Any subsequent move must involve only these remaining values, ensuring valid progression and avoiding illegal steps such as reusing numbers or operating on outdated sets.\n\nAnother critical aspect is avoiding illegal moves\u2014actions that operate on values no longer present or that improperly reuse or omit numbers. Proper tracking of the evolving set of remaining numbers is essential to prevent such errors. Moves that attempt to operate on a number that has already been used, or that drop or double-count numbers, compromise the validity of the approach.\n\nFurthermore, moves that produce intermediate results conducive to reaching 24 typically lead to multiple pathway options. For instance, generating 6 (via 7 - 1) opens multiple routes: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24, or 6 \u00d7 2 = 12, which can then be combined further. Moves that lead to less flexible intermediate values, or that create complex, hard-to-resolve states, are less promising.\n\nIn the specific scenario involving the set 1, 2, 4, 7, initial operations like 7 - 1 = 6 are promising because"

The key is to focus on operations that produce 6 and 8, as these can be combined straightforwardly to reach the target.\n\n**Primary steps:**\n\n1. **Create 6:**  \nSubtract 1 from 7: `7 - 1 = 6`. This step is reliable and preserves the remaining numbers for subsequent operations.\n\n2. **Create 8:**  \nMultiply 4 by 2: `4 * 2 = 8`. This straightforward multiplication yields 8 efficiently.\n\n3. **Combine 6 and 8:**  \nTo reach 24, consider the relationship between 6 and 8. Dividing 6 by 2 (which is available after initial operations) gives 3: `6 / 2 = 3`. Then, multiply 8 by 3: `8 * 3 = 24`. This approach relies on the availability of 2 after generating 6, which is valid if operations are performed sequentially without reusing numbers.\n\n**Alternate pathways:**\n\n- Recognize that from the leftover numbers after initial steps (6, 2, 4), some direct combinations do not yield 24, such as `6 + 4 + 2 = 12`, or `6 * 2 = 12`.  \n- Notably, multiplying 6 by 4 (`6 * 4`) gives 24 directly, but if prior operations or constraints prevent this, it may not be viable.\n\n**Insights from recent attempts:**\n\n- Attempts to construct 24 directly from the remaining numbers after initial steps often encounter invalid steps or dead ends. For example, trying `6 + 4 + 2` or `6 * 2",
                    "value_summary": "In the context of the {1, 2, 4, 7} puzzle, effective moves are those that generate intermediate results with strategic flexibility toward reaching 24 efficiently. Past insights emphasize that producing a 'nice' number\u2014particularly 6\u2014is highly promising, as it directly facilitates reaching 24 via simple multiplication (e.g., 6 \u00d7 4 = 24). Moves that yield such manageable intermediates\u2014like subtracting 1 from 7 to get 6\u2014are prioritized because they streamline the path to the solution. Conversely, results like 11 (from 7 + 4) tend to produce convoluted routes with fewer options, increasing the risk of dead-ends. Therefore, evaluating moves should focus on whether they produce intermediate values that can be easily combined\u2014such as 6 or 8\u2014to reach 24"

                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 1, 2, 4, 7 puzzle, a refined and strategic approach hinges on understanding the significance of resulting intermediate values and consistent, rule-abiding operations. Past insights emphasize that effective moves generate intermediate results that simplify reaching the target number 24. Key among these are numbers like 6, 8, or other multiples of 2 or 3, which can be directly or easily combined to reach 24 through simple multiplication. For example, producing a 6 (via 7 - 1) enables straightforward multiplication with 4 or 2 to reach 24 (e.g., 6 \u00d7 4 = 24). Similarly, generating 8 (e.g., from 4 + 4 or 7 + 1) provides an easy pathway (e.g., 8 \u00d7 3 = 24). Therefore, moves that lead to such \"nice\" intermediate values are highly promising, as they reduce complexity and preserve flexibility for subsequent steps.\n\nConversely, results like 11 (from 7 + 4) tend to complicate the path, offering fewer straightforward options and increasing the risk of dead-ends. When choosing a move, prioritize operations that produce manageable, versatile intermediates\u2014preferably multiples of small integers, especially 2 and 3\u2014since they can be combined with the remaining numbers to approach 24 efficiently. Moves that produce large or awkward numbers should be scrutinized, as they can introduce unnecessary complexity and reduce the probability of success.\n\nFurthermore, the legality of each move must be strictly verified. Every operation should utilize the current available numbers exactly once, without omission or duplication. After each move, confirm that the remaining numbers are correctly updated and that no numbers are used more than once or omitted. For instance, if you perform 7 \u00d7 4 = 28, the remaining numbers should be 1 and 2, and this move is valid only if both 7 and 4 are available and used precisely once.\n\nThe recent learning highlights the importance of tracking the specific intermediate values produced at each step. Moves that result in values like 6, 8, or other small, divisible numbers are particularly valuable because"

Using subtraction here preserves the other numbers for future operations.\n\n2. **Create 8 using multiplication:**  \nMultiply 4 by 2: `4 * 2 = 8`. This is a direct, valid step that yields 8 without reusing any numbers.\n\n3. **Combine 6 and 8 to reach 24:**  \nThere are two viable pathways:\n   - **Option A:** Multiply 6 by 4, but since 4 was used previously, this may be invalid unless the operation is performed before using 4 elsewhere.\n   - **Option B:** Use the intermediate 3 obtained by dividing 6 by 2: `6 / 2 = 3",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 1, 2, 4, 7 puzzle, it is crucial to prioritize operations that produce intermediate results facilitating a straightforward path toward 24. Past insights emphasize that certain intermediate values\u2014particularly those that are small, divisible, or relate directly to factors of 24\u2014are highly advantageous. Values like 6, 8, and 12 are especially promising because they can be combined with the remaining numbers through simple multiplication or addition to reach 24 efficiently. For example, generating 6 (via 7 - 1) allows for a direct multiplication with 4 (6 \u00d7 4 = 24), making it a highly promising move. Similarly, creating 8 (from 4 + 4 or 7 + 1) provides a quick route (e.g., 8 \u00d7 3 = 24). These \"manageable\" intermediate values enhance flexibility and reduce the complexity of subsequent steps.\n\nConversely, producing values such as 11 (e.g., 7 + 4) tends to complicate the path. Such results are less divisible and do not align neatly with factors of 24, thereby increasing the difficulty of reaching the target without dead-ends. Moves that lead to large, awkward, or prime numbers tend to diminish the chances of success because they limit straightforward combinations. Therefore, the evaluation model should favor moves that generate small, divisible, or strategically useful intermediates\u2014particularly multiples of 2 and 3\u2014since these can be combined with remaining numbers to reach 24 with minimal complexity.\n\nLegal operation verification remains essential. Every move must utilize the current set of available numbers exactly once, without omission or reuse. After each operation, the remaining numbers should be correctly updated, and no illegal move (such as reusing a number or dropping one unexpectedly) should be permitted. For example, performing 7 \u00d7 4"

This uses two numbers and leaves 2 and 4 remaining. Generating 6 early simplifies subsequent operations because multiplying 6 by 4 yields 24 directly.\n\n2. **Utilize remaining numbers effectively:**  \nWith 6 and 4 available, multiply to reach 24: `6 * 4 = 24`. This step uses two remaining numbers directly, achieving the target efficiently without overcomplicating the sequence.\n\n3. **Assess leftover numbers:**  \nAfter these steps, the remaining number is 2. Since the aim is 24, and we've already achieved it, the leftover number can be disregarded, as all numbers are used exactly once in the sequence.\n\n**Key insights for this specific set:**\n\n- The initial subtraction `7 - 1` to create 6 is a clean, valid move that leverages the larger and smaller numbers effectively.\n  \n- Multiplying 6 by 4 directly yields 24, making this the most straightforward path to the goal.\n\n- Avoid unnecessary or complex operations that do not contribute toward reaching 24, such as adding or dividing in less direct ways, which tend to complicate the process or lead to invalid steps.\n\n**Sequence summary:**\n\n- Step 1: `7 - 1 = 6` (remaining numbers: 2, 4, 6)\n\n- Step 2: `6 * 4 = 24` (remaining number: 2, but target achieved)\n\nThis sequence uses only valid operations and all numbers exactly once.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- Attempting to involve 2 in the calculation after creating 6 and 4 is unnecessary for reaching 24 since the direct multiplication suffices.\n\n-",
                    "value_summary": "**Refined Evaluation Model for the 1, 2, 4, 7 Puzzle**\n\nEffective moves are those that generate intermediate values facilitating a straightforward path to 24, prioritizing manageable, divisible, and strategic numbers. Generating small, highly divisible intermediates\u2014such as 6, 8, or 12\u2014is especially promising because these can be combined through simple operations to reach 24 efficiently. For instance, creating 6 via 7 - 1 allows a direct multiplication (6 \u00d7 4 = 24), offering a clear route.\n\nAvoid moves that produce prime or non-divisible intermediates like 11 (e.g., 7 + 4), as these complicate progress and often lead to dead-ends. Such numbers lack multiple factor pathways, reducing flexibility and increasing solution complexity. Instead, focus on moves that maintain options\u2014preferably generating numbers with multiple divisors\u2014thus preserving multiple avenues to reach 24.\n\nOperations should also preserve the remaining options for combining numbers. Generating intermediates like 6, 8, or 12 early on provides multiple routes, whether through addition or multiplication, to reach 24. For example, 8 (via 4 + 4 or 7 + 1) can be combined with remaining numbers to reach the target efficiently.\n\nLastly, strictly adhere to the rules: use each number exactly once"

Start by exploring pairings that produce totals close to 24. Notably, multiplying 4 and 5 yields 20, which is near 24. From 20, adding 4 (which is already used) isn\u2019t possible without reusing numbers; instead, consider using 6 or 10 to reach 24. For example, since 6 + 10 = 16, adding this to 8 (which isn't directly available), isn't straightforward. Alternatively, multiply 6 by 4 to get 24 directly: 6 \u00d7 4 = 24. This is a valid solution using only original numbers. Alternatively, 10 + 6 + 4 + 4 exceeds allowed reuse. Therefore",

For this puzzle, avoid steps that produce or rely on numbers outside the initial set, such as 19 or 20, unless they are formed explicitly through allowed operations. Prioritize operations that reduce the number of remaining values while maintaining feasibility toward 24, such as addition or multiplication of smaller numbers, and refrain from moves that lead to dead ends or impossible intermediate states (e.g., leaving only 4 and 6 when no further combination reaches 24).

Start by identifying pairs that produce intermediate totals close to 24 or facilitate reaching 24 through further operations.\n\nKey insights:\n\n1. **Prioritize direct multiplication for efficiency:** Notably, multiplying 6 by 4 yields 24 immediately (6 \u00d7 4 = 24). This direct approach instantly solves the puzzle without complex combinations.\n\n2. **Avoid multi-number operations that combine more than two numbers at once:** The previous attempt used three numbers simultaneously (10 + 6 + 4), which is invalid since each step must involve only two numbers. Break down such operations into sequential steps.\n\n3. **Use addition and subtraction to fine-tune totals:** For example, combining 10 and 5 to get 15, then adding 6 to reach 21, and finally adding 3 (if obtainable), or subtracting from 24, can help reach the target in multiple steps.\n\n4. **Leverage the remaining numbers after initial operations:** After pairing 6 and 4 to get 24, the other numbers (5 and 10) can be used to confirm solutions or check for alternative paths, but direct multiplication remains the most straightforward.\n\n5. **Systematically explore pairs:** For example, 10 + 5 = 15; then 15 + 6 = 21; then ",

This is the most efficient route, so always check for such direct multiplications first.\n\n2. **Avoid invalid multi-number operations:**  \n   The previous attempt incorrectly used 10 + 10, which is invalid because only one '10' exists in the initial set. Remember, each number can be used only once unless explicitly available multiple times.\n\n3. **Leverage addition and subtraction to approach 24:**  \n   Combine smaller numbers to get intermediate totals near 24. For example, 10 + 5 = 15, then add 6 to get 21; from there, subtract or add as needed to reach 24, provided the intermediate operations are valid.\n\n4. **Sequentially process pairs:**  \n   Break down complex operations into sequences of valid two-number operations. For instance, from 4, 5, 6, and 10:  \n   - 5 + 6 = 11  \n   - 11 + 10 = 21  \n   - 24 - 21",

Valid moves involve combining two numbers using permitted operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division\u2014to produce intermediate results solely derived from the original set. Reusing a number more times than it appears is invalid; for example, using 10 twice when only one exists is illegal. Moves that generate intermediate results outside the initial set (like 19 or 20) are not inherently problematic if they can lead toward 24, but unnecessary deviations should be avoided.

Here is a refined, concise plan tailored to this particular puzzle:\n\n**1. Prioritize direct, straightforward operations that reach 24 immediately:**  \nThe most efficient approach is to identify if any simple multiplication yields 24 directly. For this set, **6 \u00d7 4 = 24** accomplishes the goal immediately. Recognizing this, always check for such immediate solutions before exploring more complex combinations. This step is valid because it uses only the initial numbers, 6 and 4, both available at the start, and produces 24 as the final answer, ending the game efficiently.\n\n**2. Respect the rules regarding number usage and operation validity:**  \n- *Usage:* Each number can only be used once unless multiple copies are present.  \n- *Operations:* Combine exactly two numbers at a time, replacing them with their result, and then proceed with the new list.  \n- *Tracking:* After each operation, update the list of remaining numbers accurately\u2014remove the two used numbers and include the new result.  \n- *Avoid invalid operations:* Do not reuse a number or perform operations with numbers no longer present in the current list.\n\n**3. Focus on building intermediate totals close to 24 using addition and subtraction:**  \nWhen a direct multiplication isn\u2019t apparent, combine smaller numbers to approach 24. For example:  \n- 10 + 5 = 15  \n- 15 + 6 = 21  \n- Then, adjust to reach 24 by adding 3 or subtracting appropriately, provided such steps are valid and possible with remaining numbers.\n\n**4. Use addition and subtraction strategically to bridge gaps:**  \n- From the initial set, try to create sums or differences that can be combined with the remaining numbers to reach 24.  \n- For instance, adding 10 and 5 gives 15; adding 6 yields 21. To reach 24, you could consider adding 3 if it were available, or combining with other operations that produce the required total.\n\n**5. Process the puzzle sequentially, ensuring each step is valid and consistent:**  \n- For example, from 4, 5, 6, 10:  \n  - Combine 5 and 6: 5 + 6 = 11  \n  - Now, remaining numbers are 4, 10, and 11  \n  - Next, combine 10 and 11: 10 + 11",

Moves producing intermediate results outside the initial set are acceptable if they facilitate reaching 24; however, unnecessary detours should be avoided. Effective steps reduce the pool of remaining numbers"

In this set, 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 is a perfect fit. Recognizing this immediately allows you to reach the solution in a single step, saving time and complexity. Since 6 and 4 are both present at the start, this is the most efficient move. Always scan for such direct hits before exploring more convoluted combinations.\n\n**Validate Operation Legality and Number Usage:**  \n- Use each number only once unless duplicates exist; here, numbers are unique, so each can be used exactly once.  \n- When combining two numbers, replace them with their result, updating the list accordingly.  \n- Avoid operations that involve numbers no longer in the current list or reusing numbers improperly.  \n- For example, combining 5 and 4 yields 20, leaving remaining numbers as 10 and 20, provided you remove 5 and 4 from the list after their use.\n\n**If Direct Multiplication Doesn\u2019t Work, Use Addition and Subtraction Strategically:**  \nWhen immediate solutions are unavailable, look for sums or differences that approach 24. For example,  \n- 10 + 5 = 15, which is close to 24.  \n- Adding 6: 15 + 6 = 21, still 3 short of 24.  \nIn such cases, consider whether you can generate the missing 3 through remaining operations, or combine other numbers to bridge the gap.\n\n**Analyze the Remaining Numbers After Each Step Carefully:**  \nFor the set (4, 5, 6, 10):  \n- Combining 10 and 6 via subtraction: 10 - 6 = 4, which results in two 4s (from initial 4 and new 4).  \n- This move is valid and reduces the problem, but be cautious\u2014if you proceed with this, your remaining numbers are 4, 5, and 4.  \n- Next, look for ways to combine ",

The core principles involve identifying immediate solutions, respecting operation rules, and narrowing down options based on the current set after each operation.\n\n**1. Prioritize Direct Multiplication for Instant Solutions:**  \nStart by scanning for pairs of numbers that multiply directly to 24. In this set, 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 is the most evident and immediate solution. Recognizing such pairs at first glance allows you to arrive at 24 in a single step, avoiding unnecessary complexity. This move is optimal because it consumes two numbers efficiently and solves the puzzle outright. Always check for such straightforward multiplications before considering more convoluted approaches.\n\n**2. Validate Operation Legality and Number Usage:**  \nEnsure that each move uses each number exactly once unless duplicates are present\u2014here, all numbers are unique. When combining two numbers, replace them with their result to form a reduced list, then proceed with the next step. Avoid reusing numbers or performing operations that involve numbers no longer in the current list. This discipline prevents invalid moves and keeps the logical progression clear.\n\n**3. Use Addition and Subtraction Strategically When Direct Multiplication Doesn\u2019t Yield an Immediate Solution:**  \nIf no direct multiplication results in 24, look for sums or differences that approximate or move toward 24. For example,  \n- 10 + 5 = 15, which is somewhat close to 24.  \n- If you can add or subtract another number to bridge the gap, consider those options.  \nIn this set, combining 10 and 5 gives 15, and adding 6 results in 21\u2014close but still 3 short. Consider whether you can generate that missing 3 through subsequent operations.\n\n**4. Analyze and Simplify Step-by-Step, Considering the Remaining Numbers:**  \nFrom the initial set, explore combining numbers to generate intermediate targets that can lead to 24. For instance,  \n- Combining 10 and 6 via subtraction: 10 - 6 = 4. This move is valid and reduces the set to 4, 5, 4 (since the original 4 remains).  \n- Now, with two 4s and a 5, look for operations that can produce 24.  \n- Combining 5 and 4: 5 \u00d7 4 = 20, then adding the remaining 4 yields 20 + 4 = 24, which",

Moves that produce intermediate results within the original set or plausible pathways toward 24 are favorable; those that generate values outside the initial set without progressing toward 24 are dead ends. Crucially, moves must be valid\u2014using available numbers without reuse or omission\u2014and should lead to intermediate outcomes that facilitate a solution. If a move results in a number"

Based on previous attempts and analyses, the most effective tactics involve identifying straightforward, high-yield operations first, particularly those that immediately reach 24, then exploring alternative combinations systematically.\n\n**1. Prioritize Direct Multiplication for Immediate Solutions**  \nThe most efficient way to reach 24 is to look for pairs of numbers that multiply directly to 24. In this set, 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 is immediately evident. Recognizing this pair at first glance allows you to solve the puzzle in a single step: simply multiply 6 and 4, yielding 24 directly. This approach is optimal because it consumes two numbers swiftly and concludes the game without further complexity. Always scan for such pairs\u2014multiplication that hits 24 directly saves time and reduces the problem to fewer remaining numbers.\n\n**2. Use Subtraction and Addition to Generate Useful Intermediate Results**  \nIf no immediate multiplication yields 24, consider operations that produce numbers close to 24 or that help set up subsequent calculations. For example, subtracting or adding two numbers to produce a manageable target. For the set {4, 5, 6, 10}, subtracting 6 from 10 yields 4, which matches one of the original numbers. Although this move is valid, be cautious: it reduces the problem but doesn\u2019t directly solve it unless followed by operations that reach 24.\n\n**3. Leverage Subtraction to Simplify the Set**  \nIn the previous attempt, using 10 - 6 = 4 was a valid move, reducing the set to {4, 5, 4} with an intermediate result of 4. Now, with two 4s, explore multiplying or adding to reach 24. For instance, multiplying 4 \u00d7 5 = 20, then adding the remaining 4 gives 24 (20 + 4 = 24), which is a promising pathway. However, note that in the initial set, the numbers are distinct, and intermediate results are often considered new numbers. The key is to recognize that combining 4 and 5 to get 20 is valid, and then adding 4 yields 24.\n\n**4. Systematic Exploration of Combinations**  \nWhen straightforward solutions are not apparent, systematically explore combinations by pairing different numbers:\n\n- **Attempt 1:** 6 \u00d7 4 = 24 \u2192 Done.  \n- **Attempt 2:** 10 - 6 = 4, then combine 4 and 5: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20, then add the remaining 4: 20 + 4 = 24.  \n- **Attempt ",
                    "value_summary": "In the 4, 5, 6, 10 puzzle, promising moves are those that validly combine available numbers to approach or reach 24, either by reducing set size or generating intermediate values within the plausible pathway toward 24. Moves producing results outside the initial set without progressing toward 24 are unpromising, as they often lead to dead ends. Validity requires careful use of each number without reuse or omission. For this specific puzzle, generating intermediate results that maintain flexibility\u2014such as intermediate totals that can combine further\u2014is crucial. From recent attempts, moves like subtracting 6 from 10 to produce 4 and leaving {4, 5} are"

For example:\n   \n   - **Subtraction:** 10 - 6 = 4  \n   - **Result:** 4 (which is already in the set)\n   \n   Using subtraction to generate a duplicate of an existing number (like 4) can be helpful if it leads to a straightforward calculation to reach 24 later.\n\n3. **Use the Remaining Numbers to Reach 24 via Multiplication or Addition**  \n   After creating an intermediate, look to combine remaining numbers:\n   \n   - For example, if you have 5 and 4, multiplying them yields 20.\n   - Adding 4 (another 4 or a result derived earlier) can bring the total to 24.\n   \n   In this set, for instance:\n   \n   - **Step 1:** 10 - 6 = 4 \u2192 remaining numbers: 4, 5\n   - **Step 2:** 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n   - **Step 3:** 20 + 4 = 24\n   \n   However, note that in the original set, we only have one 4; if we create a duplicate of 4 via previous operations, it\u2019s acceptable as an intermediate result. But in strict rules, each number can only",

Prioritize Immediate, High-Probability Solutions**  \nQuickly scan for pairs whose multiplication directly yields 24. In this set, **6 \u00d7 4 = 24** is an optimal, straightforward move. Recognizing this opportunity early allows you to solve the puzzle in a single step, conserving effort and reducing complexity:\n\n- **Move:** 6 \u00d7 4 = 24  \n- **Outcome:** Puzzle solved immediately.\n\nThis approach should always be your first check before exploring more complicated combinations.\n\n**2. Use Subtraction to Generate Useful Intermediates**  \nWhen direct multiplication isn\u2019t possible or doesn\u2019t yield 24, consider subtraction or addition to produce intermediate numbers close to 24 or that set up easier solutions:\n\n- For example, **10 - 6 = 4** produces a 4 already present in the set, which can be useful for subsequent operations.\n- Recognize that subtraction can generate duplicates of existing numbers, enabling more flexible combinations later.\n\n**3. Exploit Remaining Numbers for Multiplicative or Additive Paths**  \nOnce an intermediate like 4 is created, combine it with other numbers to approach 24:\n\n- **Example:**  \n  - After obtaining 4 (via 10 - 6), combine with 5:  \n    - 4 \u00d7 5 = 20  \n  - Then, add 4 (if available) or adjust using remaining numbers to reach 24.\n\nHowever, in strict rules, each number can only be used once unless you generate duplicates through operations. Therefore, focus on operations that produce the necessary intermediate values without violating usage constraints.\n\n**4. Be Mindful of Operation Legality and Sequence**",

Promising moves are those that produce intermediate results maintaining flexibility\u2014ideally combining or simplifying numbers to stay within or close to a manageable range, thus preserving multiple pathways toward 24. For instance, operations that produce results like 1, 2, 3, or 6 from the initial set tend to be promising because they reduce complexity without eliminating options prematurely. Conversely, moves that generate results outside the initial set\u2014such as subtracting 6 from 10 to get 4\u2014are promising only if they lead toward combining other numbers effectively; otherwise, they risk narrowing options unnecessarily. \n\nUnpromising moves often produce results that do not directly contribute to reaching 24 or that create dead-ends, such as producing numbers that cannot be combined further to reach 24 or reduce to a single value efficiently.

Prioritize Immediate, High-Probability Solutions**  \nAlways begin by scanning for simple multiplication pairs that yield 24 directly. For this set, **6 \u00d7 4 = 24** is an immediate, straightforward solution. Recognizing and executing this move first allows you to solve the puzzle in a single step, conserving effort and avoiding unnecessary complexity:\n\n- **Move:** 6 \u00d7 4 = 24  \n- **Remaining numbers after move:** 24 (as a result) and 5, 10 (unused numbers) remain.  \n\nSince the goal of the game is to reach 24, once you perform 6 \u00d7 4, the puzzle is solved immediately. This should be your first check\u2014if possible, solve in one step.\n\n**2. Use Subtraction or Addition to Generate Useful Intermediates**  \nIf the immediate solution isn\u2019t apparent, consider operations to create intermediate numbers close to 24 or that facilitate easier paths:\n\n- Subtract 6 from 10: **10 - 6 = 4**  \n- Using this, you now have a duplicate 4 (both from original set and from subtraction).  \n- Recognizing that creating duplicates of small numbers like 4 can allow for subsequent multiplication to reach 24.\n\n**3. Exploit Remaining Numbers for Multiplicative or Additive Paths**  \nOnce an intermediate like 4 is generated (via 10 - 6), combine it with remaining numbers:\n\n- From the original set, after creating a new 4, the remaining numbers are 5 and 10 (assuming no numbers have been used yet).  \n- Now, consider multiplying 4 and 5: **4 \u00d7 5 = 20**.  \n- Add the remaining 4 (if you can recreate or use the original 4) to reach 24: **20 + 4 = 24**.  \n\nAlternatively, if you used 10 - 6 to get 4, you could also use the original 4 in the final step, ensuring each number is only used once in each operation.\n\n**4. Be Mindful of Operation Legality and Number Usage**  \nRemember, each operation must use two numbers from the current set, and each number can only be used once per operation unless it is produced as a result of an earlier operation. After each operation:\n\n- Replace the two",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves within the 4, 5, 6, 10 puzzle, key considerations focus on how each operation advances toward 24 without prematurely eliminating options or creating dead-ends. Promising moves are those that generate intermediate results conducive to reaching 24\u2014particularly numbers like 1, 2, 3, or 6\u2014since these simplify the problem and keep multiple pathways open. For example, multiplying 6 and 4 to get 24 is an excellent move, as it directly achieves the target and leaves the remaining number 10, which can be handled separately. Such moves maintain flexibility and avoid over-complication.\n\nConversely, unpromising moves are those that produce results outside a manageable range or do not contribute to reaching 24 efficiently\u2014like subtracting 6 from 10 to get 4, which is promising only if it leads to a straightforward combination later. Moves that do not adhere to the rules\u2014such as attempting to combine numbers without valid operations or reusing numbers\u2014are invalid and unpromising"

Here is a focused, step-by-step approach tailored specifically to these numbers:\n\n1. **Prioritize Immediate, Straightforward Solutions**  \nBegin by scanning for direct multiplication that yields 24 in one step. For this set, the most obvious is:\n\n- **6 \u00d7 4 = 24**  \n\nIf this move is possible in your current game state, execute it immediately. This instantly solves the puzzle without further operations, conserving effort and simplifying decision-making. In the initial set, since 6 and 4 are available, this move is always the first check.\n\n2. **Leverage Subtractions to Generate Useful Intermediates**  \nIf a quick solution isn\u2019t apparent, consider subtractions or additions that produce numbers close to 24 or that facilitate easier paths:\n\n- **10 - 6 = 4**  \n- **10 - 5 = 5** (not directly useful here but good to note)  \n- **Remaining options** involve creating duplicate 4s or other intermediate values.\n\nCreating duplicates of small numbers like 4 can be pivotal, as multiplying two 4s yields 16, which can then be combined with other numbers to reach 24.\n\n3. **Combine Generated Intermediates with Remaining Numbers**  \nAfter creating an intermediate like 4 (e.g., via 10 - 6), consider how to reach 24:\n\n- Multiply 4 by 5: **4 \u00d7 5 = 20**  \n- Add the remaining 4 (original or generated): **20 + 4 = 24**  \n\nAlternatively, if you use 10 - 6 to produce 4, then multiply that 4 by 6 (original), but since 6 is used in the initial step, ensure each number is only used once per operation unless it\u2019s produced anew.\n\n4. **Evaluate Feasibility of Operations After Each Step**  \nAlways confirm that the numbers involved are available and that you haven\u2019t reused numbers in violation of game rules. When an operation results in a number that, combined with others, can reach 24, pursue that",

Here\u2019s a concise, actionable plan:\n\n1. **Prioritize Immediate Multiplication for a Quick Win**  \nAlways scan for straightforward multiplication options that directly produce 24. The most obvious is:\n- **6 \u00d7 4 = 24**  \nExecuting this move immediately is optimal, as it solves the puzzle outright. Since 6 and 4 are both available initially, doing this first simplifies the remaining problem to the leftover numbers 10 and 5. If this direct route is possible, it\u2019s the most efficient solution.\n\n2. **Leverage Subtractions or Additions to Generate Useful Intermediates**  \nWhen direct multiplication isn\u2019t immediately available or applicable, consider operations that create intermediates close to 24:\n- **10 - 6 = 4**  \nThis produces a 4, which can be combined with other remaining numbers to reach 24. For example, after generating 4, multiply it by 5:\n- **4 \u00d7 5 = 20**  \nThen, adding the leftover 4 (if it\u2019s still available or generated again) can produce:\n- **20 + 4 = 24**  \nThis pathway is valid only if the intermediate steps do not reuse numbers or violate the rules.\n\n3. **Use Subtractions to Generate Convenient Numbers**  \nSubtractions like **10 - 6 = 4** are crucial because they generate smaller, manageable numbers that can be combined with others to reach 24. These operations are especially useful when direct multiplications are not possible.\n\n4. **Avoid Reusing or Dropping Numbers Illegally**  \nEvery move must adhere to the rule of using each number exactly once unless a new number is created through a valid operation. For example, after:\n- **10 - 6 = 4**, the remaining numbers are 4 and 5.  \n",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves for the 4, 5, 6, 10 puzzle, the focus should be on how operations impact the path toward 24, emphasizing simplicity, strategic value, and legality. Effective moves generate intermediate results that are small, factorable, or align with common 24-solving strategies\u2014particularly numbers like 1, 2, 3, or 6\u2014that facilitate straightforward calculations. For example, multiplying 6 and 4 to reach 24 is immediately promising, as it directly solves or significantly reduces complexity. Conversely, moves producing large, unwieldy, or non-factorable results tend to be less promising, as they complicate reaching 24 or do not contribute to an efficient solution. Legality is paramount; moves must use available numbers without misusing or dropping them improperly. For instance, subtracting 6 from 10 to get 4 is legal, but subsequent steps must remain valid and lead toward 24. The recent attempt highlights that illegal operations\u2014like attempting to use a number twice or performing dis"

Here\u2019s a targeted, step-by-step strategic framework:\n\n1. **Prioritize Immediate and Valid Subtraction to Generate Manageable Intermediates**  \nStart by examining if subtracting two numbers yields a useful intermediate. The most effective initial move is:\n- **10 - 6 = 4**  \nThis operation is valid, uses only the original numbers, and results in a new number (4) that can be combined with remaining numbers to approach 24. This move reduces the problem to the remaining numbers 4 and 5, facilitating subsequent operations without reusing or invalidating any numbers.\n\n2. **Leverage the Created Intermediates to Approach 24**  \nFrom the state after the initial subtraction, the remaining numbers are 4 and 5:\n- Combining these via **4 + 5 = 9** or **4 * 5 = 20** offers promising pathways; the latter is particularly direct since 20 is close to 24.  \n- Using **4 * 5 = 20**, then adding or multiplying further can produce 24:\n  - For example, if a 4 or 5 is reused or generated again through operations, then **20 + 4 = 24** is a straightforward step, but it must be verified that such reuse is legal under the rules (each number used once unless generated anew).\n\n3. **Avoid Reusing Numbers Illegally**  \nEvery step must adhere strictly to the rule of using each original number exactly once unless a new number is created through an operation. For instance:\n- After **10 - 6 = 4**, the remaining numbers are 4 and 5.  \n- Operations like **4 + 5** are legal, but **adding 4 again** or **multiplying 5 again** without reintroducing new numbers would be invalid.  \n- Recognize that generating 24 often requires combining intermedi",
                    "value_summary": "In evaluating moves with 4, 5, 6, and 10, prioritize operations that produce intermediate results closely aligned with common 24 strategies\u2014preferably small, factorable, or easily manipulated numbers like 1, 2, 3, or 6. Moves that quickly lead to 24, such as multiplying 6 by 4, are highly promising, while those resulting in large, unwieldy, or non-factorable numbers are less effective. Legality is critical; each move must correctly utilize available numbers without reuse or invalid operations. Recent insights reinforce that moves leaving difficult"

Given the latest feedback indicating certain operations are invalid, focus should be on the most straightforward, legally permissible steps.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n1. **Prioritize High-Impact, Valid Operations First**  \nLook for operations that immediately produce 24 without violating rules on number reuse. The most direct such operation is:\n- **6 * 4 = 24**  \nThis uses only the original numbers 6 and 4, producing 24 in one step. Since this is valid and uses two original numbers, it\u2019s a strong candidate for the initial move.\n\n2. **Verify Legality and Number Usage**  \nOperations must adhere strictly to the rule of using each original number exactly once unless explicitly reintroduced through prior operations. After **6 * 4 = 24**, the remaining numbers are 5 and 10, which have not been used yet. The key is recognizing that reaching 24 is achieved at this step, but the puzzle may require the entire set of numbers to be combined into 24 through a sequence of valid steps.\n\n3. **Assess the Remaining Numbers for Further Operations**  \nSince the initial operation consumes 6 and 4, the leftover numbers are 5 and 10. The challenge is to combine these with the already obtained 24 or within the remaining set to produce 24 overall. However, recent feedback indicates attempts to combine 5 and 10 with the previous result or to perform subsequent operations are invalid or lead to illegal steps.\n\n4. **Recognize Limitations Based on the Feedback**  \nGiven that subsequent steps after the initial multiplication are invalid (e.g., combining leftover numbers with the result in an illegal manner), the most reliable move is to accept **6 * 4 = 24** as the solution. Trying to incorporate remaining numbers into the final 24 appears to be invalid under the current rules or constraints.\n\n5. **Alternative Approaches Are Less Viable**  \nOther potential formulas\u2014such as **10 - 4 = 6**, then **6 * 4 = 24**, are invalid because they reuse the number 4 twice, which violates the rule of each number being used once unless explicitly created anew.

Moves that quickly lead to 24, such as multiplying 6 by 4, are highly promising, provided they are legal and use available numbers correctly. Conversely, operations that result in large, unwieldy, or non-factorable numbers are less promising, as they complicate reaching 24. Legality is essential; each move must accurately utilize the current set of numbers without reuse or errors."

Effective strategies include combining larger numbers through multiplication (e.g., 6 \u00d7 4 = 24) or reducing numbers via division to simpler forms (e.g., 10 \u00f7 5 = 2). Moves that generate straightforward, small values are more promising because they streamline subsequent calculations.

Combining larger numbers through multiplication (e.g., 6 \u00d7 4 = 24) remains highly promising, instantly achieving the target. Reducing numbers via division to small factors (e.g., 10 \u00f7 5 = 2) also proves effective, as these simplify subsequent calculations. Moves that generate large or complex intermediate values tend to hinder progress, increasing the risk of dead ends. Each step should strictly use the current set of numbers; attempts to reuse or artificially create numbers not present are invalid. From recent experience, dividing 10 by 5 to get 2 is a reliable move, leaving 2, 4, and 6,"
