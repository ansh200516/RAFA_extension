Improvement Plan:Based on the outcome of this game, it seems that my strategy of prioritizing the corners and center positions was effective. I was able to create a winning line by placing my \"O\" in position 5. \n\nTo refine my strategy, I could consider blocking my opponent's potential winning moves earlier in the game. In this game, I missed the opportunity to block my opponent from creating a line with their \"X\" in position 2. \n\nOverall, I have learned that being proactive in blocking my opponent's moves and strategically placing my own pieces can increase my chances of winning in Tic-Tac-Toe.\n\n"
