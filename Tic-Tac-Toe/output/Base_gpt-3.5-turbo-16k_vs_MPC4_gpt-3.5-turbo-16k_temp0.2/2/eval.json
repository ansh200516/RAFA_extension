Improvement Plan:Based on the outcome of the game, it seems that my opponent was able to create a line of three X's vertically in the left column, resulting in their victory. \n\nTo improve my strategy, I should focus on blocking my opponent's potential winning moves and creating my own opportunities to win. In this game, I missed the opportunity to block my opponent's line in the left column when they placed an X in position 4. Instead, I placed an O in position 3, which did not contribute to my victory.\n\nIn summary, my improvement plan is to prioritize blocking my opponent's winning moves and strategically placing my own X's or O's to create winning opportunities for myself.\n\n"
