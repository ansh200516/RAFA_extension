This is a crucial strategy in Tic-Tac-Toe.\n\n2. Aim for vertical or horizontal lines: I focused on creating a vertical line of \"O\"s, which ultimately led to my victory.

This flexibility is key in Tic-Tac-Toe, as the game can change quickly.\n\n4.

In this game, my opponent took the center position first, but I was able to use the corners and other positions effectively.\n\n5. Always keep an eye on the entire board: It's important to monitor the whole board to spot potential winning lines for both you and your opponent. This will help you to both block your opponent and create your own winning opportunities.\n\n",
