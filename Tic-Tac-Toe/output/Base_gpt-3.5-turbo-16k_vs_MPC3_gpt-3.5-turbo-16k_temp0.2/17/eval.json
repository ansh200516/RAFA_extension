Additionally, I should consider different opening moves and anticipate the opponent's possible strategies to make more informed decisions.\n\nIn summary, I have learned the importance of strategic thinking, anticipating the opponent's moves, and making calculated decisions in order to win in Tic-Tac-Toe.\n\n",
