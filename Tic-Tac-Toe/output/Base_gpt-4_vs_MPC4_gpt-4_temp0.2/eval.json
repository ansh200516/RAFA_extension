Improvement Plan:1. Always try to control the center: The center is the most important position on the board as it connects the most lines (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal). In this game, I took control of the center early on, which gave me an advantage.\n\n2. Block your opponent: If you see your opponent is about to win (has two in a row), make sure to block them. In this game, I blocked my opponent's potential win in the second row by placing my \"O\" in position 2.\n\n3. Look for opportunities to win: Always be on the lookout for a chance to win. In this game, I saw an opportunity to win by placing my \"O\" in position 8, completing a vertical line.\n\n4. Don't just react, plan ahead: Try to think a few moves ahead and plan your strategy. This will help you to not only block your opponent but also set up your own winning moves.\n\n5. Understand the importance of corners: Corners can be a strategic advantage as they are part of two potential winning lines (a row and a diagonal). In this game, my opponent took two corners but failed to utilize them effectively. In future games, I should consider taking control of the corners.\n\n",
