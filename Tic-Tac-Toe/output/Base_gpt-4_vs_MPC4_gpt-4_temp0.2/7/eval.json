It's better to prevent them from winning than to focus solely on your own strategy.\n\n3. Create multiple threats: Try to set up the board so you have two potential ways to win. This way, your opponent can only block one, and you'll win on your next turn.\n\n4. Don't ignore the center: The center is also a strategic position. If your opponent takes it, consider blocking them there.\n\n5. Be adaptable: Don't stick to one strategy. Watch your opponent's moves and adapt your strategy accordingly. \n\n6. Always look for a win: Always be on the lookout for a winning move. Sometimes, in focusing on our strategy, we can miss an obvious win. \n\n7.

Control the corners and the center: The corners and the center are the most strategic positions on the board. In this game, I controlled one corner and the center, which helped me win.\n\n3. Create multiple winning opportunities: Try to position your marks in a way that creates multiple potential winning lines. In this game, I created a vertical winning line, but I could have also won horizontally if the game had continued.\n\n4. Be proactive, not just reactive: Don't just focus on blocking the opponent's moves, but also make moves that force the opponent to react. This can disrupt their strategy and give you the upper hand.\n\n5. Always be aware of the board state: Keep track of all the empty spots on the board and the potential winning lines for both you and your opponent. This will help you make the best possible move in each turn.\n\n"
