In future games, I should prioritize blocking my opponent's potential winning moves.\n\n2. Control the center: The center position (5) is a strategic spot because it's part of more potential winning lines (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal). I should aim to control this spot early in the game if possible.\n\n3. Look ahead: I need to anticipate my opponent's moves and plan my strategy accordingly. This includes not only blocking their immediate moves but also preventing their future potential winning lines.\n\n4. Corner strategy: Occupying the corners can be a good strategy as it opens up opportunities for creating multiple winning lines. I should consider this in my future games.\n\n5.

In this game, I allowed the opponent to take the center, which gave them more opportunities to create winning lines.\n\n4.
