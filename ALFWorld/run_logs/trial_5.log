Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
In this environment, my critic assigned a 1/3 value after taking a mug and a 2/3 value after heating it. However, after putting the mug in the cabinet, I picked up a pot which was not part of the task. This led to a confusion in the task sequence. In the next trial, I will stick to the task of taking a cup, heating it, and putting it in the cabinet without picking up any other items.
Trial 1:
In this environment, my critic assigned a 1/3 value after taking a mug and a 2/3 value after heating it. However, after putting the mug in the cabinet, I picked up a pan which was not part of the task. This led to a confusion in the task sequence. In the next trial, I will stick to the task of taking a cup, heating it, and putting it in the cabinet without picking up any other items.
Trial 2:
In this environment, my critic assigned a 1/3 value after taking a mug, a 2/3 value after heating it, and a full value after putting it in the cabinet. However, after completing the task, I continued to interact with the environment, picking up a pot and a pan which were not part of the task. This led to a confusion in the task sequence. In the next trial, I will stick to the task of taking a cup, heating it, and putting it in the cabinet without picking up any other items. Once the task is completed, I should stop further interactions.
