Your memory for the task below:
Trial 0:
In this environment, my critic failed to generate any value as I didn't find or take an apple, which is the first step in the task. The task is to take an apple, heat it, and then put it in the fridge. I didn't find the apple in this trial. In the next trial, I will explore other locations to find an apple, including cabinet 5-6, countertop 3, drawer 3, fridge 1, microwave 1, sinkbasin 1, stoveburner 1, and coffeemachine 1, etc.
Trial 1:
In this environment, my critic assigned a 1/3 value after taking a soapbottle. However, the task is to take and heat an apple. I didn't find the apple in this trial. In the next trial, I will explore other locations to find an apple, including cabinet 5-6, countertop 3, drawer 3, fridge 1, microwave 1, sinkbasin 1, stoveburner 1, and coffeemachine 1, etc.
Trial 2:
In this environment, my critic assigned a 0/3 value after taking a soapbottle. However, the task is to take and heat an apple. I noticed that the apple was found on the sinkbasin 1 and in the garbagecan 1. In the next trial, I will go to sinkbasin 1 to take the apple, then go to the microwave to heat the apple, and finally put the heated apple in the fridge.
